Between 1978-1985 alongside the market-based Chinese economic reforms instituted by Deng Xiaoping, Dongfeng was transformed from a manufacturer of two heavy-duty trucks with fragmented operations and ownership into a single, centrally managed enterprise.	1978-1985年间，伴随着邓小平制定的以市场为基础的中国经济改革，东风公司从一家生产两种重型卡车、业务和所有权极为分散的制造企业，转变为一家集中管理的单一企业。
This process included placing all Dongfeng operations—from part manufacture to vehicle assembly—under the control of a single business entity and the merger of six truck production bases as well as a number of other companies previously controlled by provincial governments.	这一过程包括将东风公司的所有业务——从零件制造到车辆组装——由一个单一的商业实体来控制，合并六个卡车生产基地和以前由省政府控制的其他一些公司。
Post-1985, further reforms took place that allowed Dongfeng greater autonomy; the company was removed from the direct administrative control of the central government.	1985 年后，进一步的改革使东风公司获得了更大的自主权；该公司脱离了中央政府的直接行政管辖。

Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant; Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source, The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments, written in 340 by Ge Hong, which states that this herb should be steeped in cold water.	屠呦呦发现，可采用低温提取工艺从该植物中分离出一种有效的抗疟物质；屠呦呦表示，自己受传统中医资料《肘后备急方》的影响，此书由葛洪写于公元 340 年，书中写明这种草药应当冷水浸泡。
This book contained the direction to immerse a handful of qinghao in the equivalent of two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all.	这本书中所写的方法是将一把青蒿浸泡在两升水中，绞出汁液并全部喝下。

The airport was built in 1936 during Japanese rule with its origins as a Japanese military airbase, the Taihoku Airfield (Japanese: 臺北飛行場 Hepburn: Taihoku Hikōjō), also known as Matsuyama Airfield (松山飛行場).	该机场建于 1936 年日据时期，最初为日本军用空军基地“台北飞行场”，又称“松山飞行场”。
After World War II, in 1946, it was taken over by the Republic of China Air Force.	二战后，于 1946 年由中华民国空军接管。
Before the end of the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the airport provided flight routes between Shanghai and Taipei, occasionally via Fuzhou.	在国共内战结束和中华人民共和国成立之前，该机场提供上海与台北之间的航班，偶尔途经福州。
Shared military and civilian use—both domestic and international—began on 16 April 1950 in the reconstructed Civil Aeronautics Administration Taipei Airport (交通部民用航空局台北航空站).	1950 年 4 月 16 日，在重建后的“交通部”民用航空局台北航空站开启军民共享，既有国内的也有国际的。
Domestic destinations have been Kaohsiung, Hualien, Taichung, Penghu, and Tainan.	境内目的地有高雄、花莲、台中、澎湖和台南。
The first international destinations were Seattle, Tokyo, Pusan, Manila, Bangkok, and Hong Kong.	第一批国际目的地为西雅图、东京、釜山、马尼拉、曼谷和香港。
The first international airlines included Northwest Airlines, Pan American Airlines, and Hong Kong Airways (now Cathay Pacific).	首批国际航空公司包括西北航空、泛美航空和香港航空（现在的国泰航空）。
Later, the airport became too small to handle an increased number of passengers, even after a series of expansions.	后来，即使经过一系列扩建，机场也不足以处理增加的乘客数量。
This later worsened when new wide-body jets became common at the airport.	之后，当新的宽体式喷气飞机成为机场常客时，这种情况就恶化了。
Therefore, all international activities were relocated to Taoyuan International Airport (then known as Chiang Kai-shek International) after its inauguration on 26 February 1979.	因此，1979 年 2 月 26 日桃园国际机场（当时名为中正国际机场）启用后，所有的国际活动都迁往该机场。
Consequently, the passenger load at the airport dropped from 6.2 million in 1978 to 2.9 million in 1979 (a 53% decrease).	机场客运量因此从 1978 年的 620 万降至 1979 年的 290 万（减少53%）。
At its peak in 1997, the airport handled over 15.3 million passengers annually.	在 1997 年的高峰期，该机场年处理 1530 多万旅客。
Service to Taichung and Chiayi was stopped in mid-2007 after the load factor dropped significantly due to Taiwan High Speed Rail start of revenue service in January 2007.	由于台湾高铁从 2007 年 1 月开始提供收入服务，使得载客率大幅下降，至台中和嘉义的服务于 2007 年中停止。
Passenger volume decreased from 6.7 million in 2006 to 4.4 million in 2007 (a 34% decrease).	客运量从 2006 年的 670 万减少到 2007 年的 440 万（减少34%）。
Also due to the opening of the high speed rail line, on 1 March 2008, Uni Air suspended its service to Kaohsiung, while Far Eastern Air Transport suspended its service to Tainan.	同样由于高铁线路开通，2008年1月立荣航空暂停了至高雄的服务，而远东航空也暂停了至台南的服务。
TransAsia Airways decided to stop flights to Tainan and Kaohsiung after 1 August 2008.	复兴航空决定 2008 年 8 月 1 日之后，停飞至台南和高雄的航班。
In early 1999 when the construction of Taipei 101 had just started, Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration changed this airport's certain SID and STAR procedures to avoid possible collision with the building.	1999 年初，当台北 101 大厦刚开始动工时，台湾的交通部民用航空局更改了该机场的某些 SID 和 STAR 程序，以避免与该楼相撞。
The 677-meter Fuxing North Road Underground Passage (復興北路車行地下道) was constructed between 1997 and 2006 under this airport's runway to link the north and south side of this airport.	677 米长的复兴北路车行地下道从 1997 年至 2006 年修建于该机场跑道地下，用于连接该机场南北两侧。
Regular cross-Strait charter flights to China started on 4 July 2008, with Songshan receiving the majority of flights.	2008 年 7 月 4 日，两岸定期包机开通，松山机场接收大部分航班。
Direct flights to China were an issue of contention.	至中国大陆的直飞航班是一个有争议的问题。
Then-mayor Ma Ying-jeou had been pressing to make Songshan Airport Taipei's main International terminal, citing that its location close to the city center would make it preferable for business travelers.	时任市长马英九一直极力要求把松山机场作为台北的主要国际航站楼，理由是其位置靠近市中心，更适合商旅人士。
However, building height restrictions around the airport raised concerns about flight safety, blocking of radio communications, noise pollution, and a reduced number of flights.	但机场周围的建筑高度限制，引起人们对飞行安全、无线电通讯受阻、噪音污染和航班数量减少的担忧。
The continuing growth of Taipei City means that Songshan airport is situated in the heart of downtown Taipei.	台北市的持续增长意味着松山机场坐落于台北市中心的核心地带。
Compared to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Songshan Airport saves travelers about 30 minutes due to its location inside Taipei City's central business district, but the city suffers from the noise, pollution, restrictions on urban planning, and traffic congestion the airport brings about.	与台湾桃园国际机场相比，由于在台北市的中央商务区内，松山机场可为旅客节省约30分钟时间，但该市却饱受机场带来的噪音、污染、城市规划限制和交通拥堵的困扰。
In the 2002 and 2006 Taipei Mayor Election DPP candidates Lee Ying-yuan and Frank Hsieh both proposed the plan to close Songshan Airport, and developed its land into road, huge park, detention basin and sports arena, since the Taiwan High Speed Rail could quickly take up the traffic load between Taipei and western Taiwan cities, and the remaining service to outlying islands and eastern Taiwan could be easily taken over by the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport after the completion of Taoyuan International Airport Access MRT System by the end of 2016.	在 2002 年和 2006 年的台北市长选举中，民进党候选人李应元和谢长廷都提议关闭松山机场，并将其土地开发为道路、大型公园、泄洪池以及体育场，理由是台湾高铁可以迅速承担起台北和台湾西部城市之间的交通负荷，而到2016年底，桃园国际机场通道捷运系统建成后，其余至离岛和台湾东部的服务可由台湾桃园国际机场轻松承担。
Also, the MRT system will make the international potential of Songshan airport less attractive.	此外，捷运系统将令松山机场的国际潜力失去吸引力。
The Songshan Airport closing proposal was deferred under the Taipei City Government which has long been dominated by the Pan-Blue Coalition, who prefers the downtown airport connection concept with Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo.	关闭松山机场的提案被台北市政府推迟，该市政府长期以来一直由泛蓝联盟主导，他们更倾向于上海、首尔和东京的市中心机场连接的概念。
Due to the introduction of Taiwan-China flights and future international potential, the airport is undergoing extensive renovations, the first phase of which is expected to be completed by October 2010.	由于开通两岸航班和未来的国际潜力，该机场正在进行大范围翻修，第一阶段预计将在 2010 年 10 月完成。

However, as of November 2011 renovations are still in progress.	但截至 2011 年 11 月，翻新工作仍在进行。
A new international cargo terminal is being built in anticipation of a new air route between Taiwan and Japan.	为迎接台湾与日本之间的新航线，正在建设一座新的国际货运航站楼。

On 29 March 2011, the renovated Terminal 2 was re-opened to handle domestic flights.	2011 年 3 月 29 日，翻修一新的 2 号航站楼重新开放，用于接待国内航班。
Songshan Airport is seen to have the potential to attract business travelers within Pacific Asia due to its location in downtown Taipei.	由于地处台北市中心，松山机场被认为有潜力吸引亚太地区的商务旅客。
Flights to Bangkok–Don Mueang, Jakarta–Halim Perdanakusuma, Kuala Lumpur–Subang, Singapore–Seletar, Nagoya–Komaki, Osaka–Itami, Seoul–Gimpo, Shanghai–Hongqiao, Beijing–Nanyuan, and Tokyo–Haneda are especially attractive since these airports are also in the central areas of their respective cities, and all these cities have larger far flung international airports.	前往曼谷-廊曼机场、雅加达-哈利姆·珀达纳库苏马机场、吉隆坡-梳邦机场、新加坡-实里达机场、名古屋-小牧机场、大阪-伊丹机场、首尔-金浦机场、上海-虹桥机场、北京-南苑机场、东京-羽田机场的航班特别吸引人，因为这些机场也都位于各自城市的中心地区，所有这些城市都有更大更远的国际机场。
The airport is currently in the process of expansion to better accommodate international flights.	机场目前正在扩建，以便更好地适应国际航班。
On 6 March 2009, Japan and Taiwan signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the revision of Taiwan–Japan bilateral traffic.	2009 年 3 月 6 日，日本与台湾签署了一份关于修改台日双边交通的谅解备忘录。

The first suncakes were made by the Lin family in the She-Ko area of Shengang Township, Taichung County (now part of Taichung City).	第一批太阳饼由台中县（现属台中市）神岗乡社高地区的林氏家族制作。
The Lin family used condensed malt sugar as a filling for cake pastries.	林家使用浓缩麦芽糖作为糕点馅料。
Later on, pastry maker Wei Qing-hai modified the cakes to their current form.	后来糕点师魏清海将糕点改良成现在的样子。

The name was not trademarked, and other pastry shops have used the same name for their own suncakes.	这个名称并未注册商标，其他糕饼店对自家的太阳饼也使用同样的名称。
Shenyang literally means "the Yang side of the Shen River", referring to the location of the Hun River (formerly called the Shen River, 瀋水; Shěn Shuǐ), on the southern side of the city.	沈阳的字面意思是“沈河的阳面”，指的是浑河（以前叫“沈水”）的位置，位于城市南面。
According to Chinese tradition, a river's north bank and a mountain's south slope are considered to be the "sunny" – or "Yang" – side.	根据中国传统，河的北岸和山的南坡被视为“阳”面。
Archaeological findings show that humans resided in present-day Shenyang as early as 8,000 years ago.	考古发现表明，早在 8000 年前就有人类居住在今天的沈阳。

The city, now known as Shenyang, was first established in about 300 BCE during the Warring States period by Yan general Qin Kai, who conquered the Liaodong region, and was then named Hou City (侯城; Hóu Chéng).	这座城市，也就是现在的沈阳，最早是在公元前300年战国时期，由征服辽东地区的燕国将领秦开建立，当时名为“侯城”。
However, around 350 years later during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of Han, the city was sacked and burnt by the Donghu nomads and subsequently abandoned.	然而，大约 350 年后，这座城市在汉光武帝时期遭东胡游牧民族洗劫焚毁，随后被废弃。
It came back to prominence during early Liao dynasty and was known as the Shen Prefecture (瀋州; Shěn Zhōu) through to the end of Jin dynasty, and became the Shenyang Circuit (瀋陽路; Shěnyáng Lù) during the Yuan dynasty.	辽代初期，这座城市又开始崭露头角，直至金朝末年，一直被称为“沈州”，在元朝时成为“沈阳路”。
During the Ming dynasty, it was designated as a "guard town" (militarized settlements, such as walled/heavily garrisoned cities or towns) named Shenyang Central Guard (瀋陽中衛; Shěnyáng Zhōngwèi) and gradually became one of the most important strongholds beyond the Shanhai Pass.	明朝时，被指定为“卫城”（军事化的定居点，比如有城墙/重兵把守的城市或镇），名为“沈阳中卫”，逐渐成为山海关外最重要的据点之一。
In 1625, the Manchu leader Nurhaci captured Shenyang and decided to relocate his entire administrative infrastructures to the city, or Simiyan hoton (Manchu: ᠰᡳᠮᡳᠶᠠᠨ	1625 年，满族首领努尔哈赤占领沈阳，决定将其全部行政基础设施迁至这座城市，也叫 Simiyan hoton（满语：ᠰᡳᠮᡳᠶᠠᠨ
ᡥᠣᡨᠣᠨ) as it is called in Manchu language.	ᡥᠣᡨᠣᠨ）按照其满语发音。
The official name was changed to Shengjing (盛京; Shèng Jīng; 'rising capital'), or Mukden (Manchu: ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠨ), in 1634.	1634 年，官方名称改为“盛京”（“崛起的首都”），又叫“穆克敦”（满语：ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠨ）。
The new name derives from the Manchu word, mukdembi (Manchu: ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠮᠪᡳ), meaning "to rise" as reflected also by its Han Chinese name.	新名称来自满语词汇 mukdembi （满语：ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠮᠪᡳ），意思是“上升”，这在其汉语名称中也有所体现。
Under Nurhaci's orders, the Imperial Palace was constructed in 1626, symbolizing the city's emerging status as the Jurchen political center.	依照努尔哈赤的命令，沈阳故宫于 1626 年开建，象征该城作为女真政治中心的新兴地位。

However, Shenyang retained considerable importance as the secondary capital and the spiritual home of the Qing dynasty through the centuries.	但沈阳作为清朝的陪都和精神家园，几百年来一直保持相当重要的地位。
Treasures of the royal house were kept at its palaces, and the tombs of the early Qing rulers were once among the most famous monuments in China.	皇室珍宝保存在宫殿中，前清统治者的陵墓曾是中国最著名的古迹之一。
In 1657, Fengtian Prefecture (奉天府; Fèngtiān Fŭ; Manchu: ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ	1657 年，奉天府（满语：ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ

After the First Sino-Japanese War, Japan coerced the annexation of the Liaodong Peninsula with the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, though was forced to give it up due to diplomatic pressure from the Triple Intervention.	甲午战争后，日本于 1895 年以《马关条约》胁迫吞并辽东半岛，但迫于三国干涉的外交压力而放弃。
In the aftermath of the Japanese threat, Qing viceroy Li Hongzhang visited Moscow in 1896 and signed a secret treaty with Russian foreign minister Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, allowing Imperial Russia to build a Russian gauge railway in Manchuria, which opened the door towards further Russian expansionism in the form of another lease convention in 1898, effectively allowing Russia to annex Port Arthur in all but name.	在被日本人威胁之后，清朝总督李鸿章于 1896 年出访莫斯科，与俄国外交大臣罗拔诺甫签订了一项秘密条约，允许沙皇俄国在满洲修建一条俄制轨距的铁路，这为俄国在 1898 年以另一项租约的形式进一步扩张打开了大门，实际上允许俄国在事实上吞并旅顺口。
However, after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Russian forces used the anti-foreigner insurgency as a pretext to formally invade and occupied most of Manchuria, and Mukden became a Russian stronghold in the Far East with the building of the South Manchurian Railway.	但在 1900 年义和团运动之后，俄国军队以反外国人叛乱为借口，正式入侵并占领了满洲的大部分地区，随着南满铁路的修建，穆克敦成为俄国在远东地区的一个据点。
During the Russo-Japanese War (1904—1905), Mukden was the site of the Battle of Mukden from February 19 to March 10, 1905. Involving more than 600,000 combat participants, it was the largest battle since the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, and also the largest modern-era battle ever fought in Asia before World War II.	日俄战争期间（1904-1905 年），穆克敦是 1905 年 2 月 19 日至 3 月 10 日奉天会战所在地。有 60 多万人参战，是自 1813 年莱比锡战役以来规模最大的一次战役，也是二战前亚洲打过的最大的一次现代战争。
Following the Japanese victory, Mukden became one of the chief bases of Japanese presence and economic expansion into southern Manchuria.	日本胜利后，奉天成为日本在南满洲驻扎及经济扩张的主要根据地之一。
It also became the government seat of Fengtian province in 1910.	在 1910 年，也成为奉天省的政府所在地。
In 1914, the city changed back to its old name Shenyang, but continued to be known as Mukden (sometimes spelled Moukden) in some English sources and in Japan through much of the first half of 20th century.	1914 年，该市改回其旧名沈阳，但在 20 世纪上半叶的大部分时间里，一些英文资料和日本国内继续称之为奉天（有时拼为Moukden）。
The postmark of the Chinese postal administration kept the spelling "MOUKDEN/奉天" for usage on international mails until the late 1920s.	中国邮政管理局在国际邮件的邮戳上一直保留“MOUKDEN/奉天”的写法，直至 20 世纪 20 年代末。
After that, a Chinese–Manchurian bilingual type "SHENYANG (MUKDEN)/瀋陽 (奉天)" datestamp was used until 1933.	此后，“SHENYANG（MUKDEN）/沈阳（奉天）”的满汉双语日期戳一直使用至 1933 年。
In the early 20th century, Shenyang began expanding out of its old city walls.	20 世纪初，沈阳开始向老城墙外扩张。
The Shenyang Railway Station on the South Manchurian Railway and the Shenyang North Railway Station on the Jingfeng Railway, both west of the old city, became the new commercial centers of Shenyang.	南满铁路沈阳火车站和京奉铁路沈阳北站均位于老城西边，成为沈阳新的商业中心。
In the 1920s, Mukden was the capital of the warlord Zhang Zuolin, who was later assassinated when his train was blown up on 4 June 1928 at a Japanese-guarded railway bridge.	20 世纪 20 年代，奉天是军阀张作霖的首府，1928 年 6 月 4 日，张作霖乘坐的火车在一座由日本人守卫的铁路桥上爆炸，遭暗杀身亡。
At the time, several factories were built by Zhang to manufacture ammunition in the northern and eastern suburbs.	当时，张作霖在北郊和东郊建了多家工厂，生产弹药。
These factories laid the foundation for Shenyang's industrial development.	这些工厂为沈阳的工业发展奠定了基础。
At around 10:20 pm on 18 September 1931, a small quantity of dynamite was detonated close to a railway line near Mukden owned by the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company by Kwantung Army Lt.	1931 年 9 月 18 日晚 10:20 左右，少量炸药在日本南满铁路公司拥有的奉天附近的一段铁路线旁被引爆，肇事者为关东军中尉
Kawamoto Suemori.	河本末守。
The Imperial Japanese Army, accusing Chinese dissidents of the act, then use the false flag explosion as pretext to launch a full attack on Mukden, and captured the city the following morning (September 19).	日本帝国陆军谴责中国持不同政见者做出此举，随后以假国旗爆炸为借口，对奉天发动全面进攻，并于次日上午（9 月 19 日）占领该城。
After the Mukden Incident, the Japanese further invaded and occupied the rest of Northeast China, and created the puppet state of Manchukuo with the deposed emperor Aisin Gioro Puyi as the figurehead.	“九·一八”事变后，日本进一步入侵并占领了中国东北其他地区，并建立了伪满洲国，以逊帝爱新觉罗·溥仪作为傀儡。
During the Manchukuo era (1932–1945), the city was again called Fengtian (and Mukden in English), and was developed by the Japanese into a center of heavy industry.	在伪满时期（1932-1945 年），这座城市再次被称为奉天（英语Mukden），日本人将其发展成一个重工业中心。
Japan was able to exploit resources in Manchuria using the extensive network of railroads.	日本可以利用四通八达的铁路网络，开发满洲资源。
For example, vast expanses of Manchurian forest were chopped down.	例如，大片的满洲森林遭到砍伐。
The development of Shenyang was also unbalanced in this period; municipal facilities were mostly located in Japanese residential areas, while Chinese residential areas had poor living conditions.	沈阳在这一时期的发展也不平衡，市政设施大多位于日本人居住区，而中国人居住区的生活条件较差。
Under Marshal of the Soviet Union Aleksandr Vasilevsky, the Far East Command of Soviet forces entered Manchuria in early August 1945 following the surrender of Japan.	日本投降后，在苏联元帅亚历山大·华西列夫斯基的指挥下，苏联军队远东司令部于 1945 年 8 月初进入满洲。
On 16 August 1945, Manchurian Emperor Puyi was captured in Shenyang Airport by the Soviet Red Army while he was in an airplane fleeing to Japan.	1945 年 8 月 16 日，伪满皇帝溥仪在沈阳机场被苏联红军抓获，当时他正在逃往日本的飞机上。
On 20 August, Soviet troops captured Shenyang.	8 月 20 日，苏军占领沈阳。
British and US reports indicate that the Soviet troops that occupied Northeast China and Eastern Inner Mongolia region looted and terrorized the people of Shenyang, and were not discouraged by Soviet authorities from "three days of rape and pillage".	英国和美国的报道表明，苏联军队占领了中国东北和内蒙古东部地区，对沈阳百姓进行劫掠和恐吓，并且不顾苏联当局劝阻，进行了“为期三天的强奸和抢劫”。
The Soviets were replaced by the Nationalist Chinese, who were flown in on U.S. transport planes.	苏联人被乘坐美国运输机涌入的中国国民党所取代。
During the Chinese Civil War, Shenyang remained a Kuomintang stronghold from 1946 to 1948, although the Chinese communists controlled the surrounding countryside.	国共内战期间，从 1946 年到 1948 年，沈阳一直是国民党根据地，但中国共产党控制了周围的农村地区。
It was captured by the communists on October 30, 1948, following a series of offensives known as the Liaoshen Campaign.	经过辽沈战役的一系列进攻，1948 年 10 月 30 日，共产党攻占该城。
Over the past 200 years or so, Shenyang managed to grow and increase its industrial might, despite consecutive wars with Russia and Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Second World War, and China's Civil War (Shenyang became the main battleground between the Communists and Nationalists).	在过去 200 年左右的时间里，尽管经历了 19 世纪末 20 世纪初与日本和俄国接连开战、第二次世界大战、国共内战（沈阳是共产党和国民党之间的主战场），沈阳还是发展壮大了自己的工业实力。
The old city of Shenyang resided almost entirely within the modern day Shenhe District, and used to have two city walls.	沈阳古城几乎完全位于现在的沈河区内，曾有两堵城墙。
Situated roughly within the area bounded by the four "Shuncheng" (顺城; 'along the city walls') roads/streets in Shenhe District, the (now-demolished) square-shaped inner city wall marked the bounds of ancient Shenyang.	四方形的内城墙（现已拆除）大致位于沈河区以四条“顺城”路/街为界的区域内，标明了古沈阳的地界。
The earliest wall was built in 926 during early Liao dynasty to settle Northern Song civilians the Khitans abducted from raids to use as slave labourers, and was then made of rammed earth because the city was merely a small settlement at the time (historically the administrative center of the Liaodong region was at Liaoyang).	最早的城墙建于辽代初期 926 年，用于安置在突袭中被契丹人掳走当作奴隶劳工的北宋平民，由于当时的城市只是一个小定居点（历史上辽东地区的行政中心位于辽阳），当时采用夯土建造。
However, in 1368, Hongwu Emperor of the newly founded Ming dynasty ordered a new regional military command—the Liaodong Regional Military Commission (遼東都指揮使司)—to be established, and Shenyang was made a prominent regional "guard town" (衛所).	但在 1368 年，新建立的明朝的洪武皇帝下令建立一个新的地区军事指挥部——辽东都指挥使司，沈阳成为了著名的地区“卫所”。
In 1388, Min Zhong (閔忠), the newly appointed city commissioner of the Shenyang Central Guard, wrote to Hongwu Emperor immediately upon his tenure requesting permission to upgrade the city wall, and the old wall was made taller and thoroughly reinforced with overlaid bricks.	1388 年，新任沈阳中卫城指挥使闵忠刚一上任就致信洪武皇帝，请求批准升级城墙，对旧城墙进行加高，并用覆土砖彻底加固。
According to History of Ming, the reconstructed Ming-era wall was 2.5 zhàngs (8 metres or 26 feet) tall, more than 1 zhàng (3.2 metres or 10.5 feet) wide at the top, and 9 lis and 30 bus (about 5.2 kilometres or 3.2 miles) long.	据《明史》记载，重建的明城墙高 2.5 丈（8 米或 26 英尺），顶宽超过 1 丈（3.2 米或 10.5 英尺），长 9 里 30 步（约 5.2 公里或 3.2 英里）。
It has two layers of moats dug outside, each being 3 zhàngs (9.6 metres or 31.5 feet) wide and 8 chis (2.56 metres or 8 feet 4.8 inches) deep, fed with water from Shen River.	墙外挖了两道护城河，各 3 丈（9.6 米或 31.5 英尺）宽，深 8 尺（2.56 米或 8 英尺 4.8 英寸），水源来自沈河。
There were four city gates, each at the center of one side, connected by two main roads that intersected at Central Temple of the city's center in a "+" fashion.	有四扇城门，各位于每侧城墙正中，由两条主路相连，在城中心的中央庙十字相交。
This Ming wall was heavily damaged in 1625 after the Manchu laid siege and captured the city, with only the north wall and gate (which had undergone reinforcing reconstructions in 1545 under the orders of Jiajing Emperor) remained intact.	1625 年，满族围攻占领该城后，明城墙遭到严重破坏，只有北面的城墙和城门（1545 年嘉靖皇帝下令加固重建）完好无损。
The Manchu leader Nurhachi however saw the strategic value of the city, and decided to formally relocate his Later Jin capital from Liaoyang to Shenyang, and ordered the city wall to be rebuilt.	但满族领袖努尔哈赤看到了这座城市的战略价值，决定正式将他的后金都城从辽阳迁至沈阳，并下令重修城墙。
According to Annals of Mukden (盛京通志), the new city wall was a standard black brick wall standing at a height of 3.5 zhàngs (about 12.5 metres or 41.0 feet), a width of 1.8 zhàngs (about 6.4 metres or 21.0 feet) and a total length of 9 lis and 332 bus (about 6.4 kilometres or 4.0 miles) long, complete with 12 towers (8 gate and 4 corner) and a 14.5 zhàngs (about 52-metre or 171-foot) wide moat.	据《盛京通志》记载，新城墙为标准青砖墙，高 3.5 丈（约 12.5 米或 41.0 英尺），宽 1.8 丈（约 6.4 米或 21.0 英尺），总长度 9 里 332 步（约 6.4 公里或 4.0 英里），有 12 座塔楼（8 门 4 角）和一条宽 14.5 丈（约 52 米或 171 英尺）的护城河。
The city gates were increased from four to eight, though the old Ming-era north gate and tower was preserved but sealed shut, later known as the "Ninth Gate" (九門).	城门从四个增加到八个，虽然旧的明代北门和塔楼得以保留，但被封死，后来被称为“九门”。
The outer city wall, called the "peripheral wall" (邊牆; Biān Qiáng) or "pass wall" (關牆; Guān Qiáng), was actually a rammed earth rampart built in 1680 to expand the urban area outside the inner city.	外城墙称为“边墙”或“关墙”，实际上是建于 1680 年的一道夯土墙，向内城之外扩大城市区域。
It was almost round in shape, standing at a height of 7.5 chis (around 2.7 metres or 8 feet 10.3 inches) and an overall length of 32 lis and 24 bus (about 20.7 kilometres or 12.9 miles), and also had eight gates known as the "peripheral gates" (邊門; Biān Mén).	几乎为圆形，高 7.5 尺（约 2.7 米或 8 英尺 10.3 英寸），总长 32 里 24 步（约 20.7 公里或 12.9 英里），也有八个门，称为“边门”。
The corresponding inner and outer gates were linked by roads that intersected within the inner city in a "#" pattern around the Mukden Palace.	对应的内外城门以道路相连，这些路在沈阳故宫周围相交成“井”字形。
Nearly all of these city walls and gates were demolished after 1949.	几乎所有这些城墙和城门都在 1949 年后被拆除。
Two gates and one corner tower of the inner wall were rebuilt during the 1990s.	20 世纪 90 年代，重建了内城的两个城门和一座角楼。
There had, however, been proposals to rebuild the other gates and towers in preparation to the 12th National Games in 2013.	但是，曾有人提议重建其他城门和城楼，以迎接 2013 年的第十二届全运会。
Around 2.5 km (1.6 mi) outside Shenyang's former outer wall, there were four pagodas each located within an associated Tibetan buddhist temple, namely the East Pagoda in Yongguang Temple (永光寺), the South Pagoda in Guangci Temple (廣慈寺), the West Pagoda in Yanshou Temple (延壽寺) and the North Pagoda in Falun Temple (法輪寺).	沈阳原外城墙外约 2.5 公里（1.6 英里）处，有四座宝塔，每座塔都坐落在相关的藏传佛教寺庙内，即永光寺东塔、广慈寺南塔、延寿寺西塔和法轮寺北塔。
They were built in 1643 and completed in 1645.	这些塔于 1643 年开建，1645 年建成。
The four pagodas are identical white Buddha-stupas as tall as 26 m (85 ft).	这四座宝塔为一模一样的白色佛塔，高 26 米（85 英尺）。
Nowadays only the temple for the North Pagoda is well preserved, the East and South has only the pagodas left, and the temple for the West Pagoda was rebuilt in 1998.	现在只有北塔的寺庙保存完好，东塔和南塔只剩塔体，西塔寺庙于 1998 年重建。
Both the Temple of Heaven and Temple of Earth were also to be found in the old city during the Qing dynasty.	清代时也曾在古城中发现天坛和地坛。
They were smaller replicas of Beijing's counterparts.	是北京天坛和地坛的小型复制品。
Neither exists today.	如今都不复存在。

The central urban area is surrounded by three artificial rivers—respectively the South Canal (南运河) from the south and southeast, the Xinkai River (新开河, formerly the North Canal) from the north and northeast, and the Weigong River (卫工河, formerly the Weigong Nullah) from the west, all interconnected by channels as a continuous waterway.	中央城区被三条人工河包围——分别是南面到东南面的南运河，北面到东北面的新开河，以及西面的卫工河，均通过水渠互相连接，成为一条连续的水道。
The South Canal in particular, famous for the series of linear parks and gardens along it, was constructed upon the old course of the Wanquan River (萬泉河; 'ten thousand springs river'), historically also called the Little Shen River (小瀋水) or Wuli River (五里河; 'five-li river'), which was a principal water source for the old city.  These are reinforced on the peripheries by smaller rivers such as Xi River (细河), Puhe River (蒲河) and Mantang River (满堂河), and drains into the Hun River at three different locations on the southeast, due south and southwest side of the city.	特别是南运河，以沿岸的长条形公园和花园而闻名，是在万泉河的旧道上修建的，这条河在历史上也称为小沈水或五里河，是古城的主要水源。细河、蒲河和满堂河等较小的河流在外围流入这些河，在城市的东南方、正南方和西南方三个不同地点汇入浑河。
There was also previously another canal on the east side called Huishan Nullah (辉山明渠) that drains into Xinkai River's lower section, but is now no longer existent due to land reclamation from urban constructions.	以前东边还有另一条运河，叫辉山明渠，汇入新开河下游，但由于城市建设填土，现已不存在。

He is known for using the cultural debris of our modern society, such as old, discarded books, newspapers, phonebooks, and magazines as the medium for his sculptures.	他以使用我们现代社会的文化碎片作为雕塑媒介而闻名，例如被丢弃的旧的书籍、报纸、电话簿和杂志。
Chen is self-taught in carving wood, but started showing interest in our paper culture as a viable material for art – phonebooks, magazines, and computer paper when PC’s began growing popular in 1993.	陈龙斌自学木雕，当个人电脑在 1993 年开始流行时，他开始表现出对于把我们的纸文化（电话簿、杂志和电脑用纸）作为一种可行的艺术材料的兴趣。
The advent of the personal computer changed the entire nature of information documentation – a role books used to play.	个人电脑的出现彻底改变了信息记录的性质，书本曾经发挥这一作用。
Thus, by turning paper into the original wood for his sculptures, Chen offers renewed value to the meaning of paper.	因此，通过把纸变成其雕塑的原木，陈龙斌为纸张赋予了新的价值。

For Chen, using recycled materials to make art stresses the challenges presented by endless human consumption and waste, as well as the tantamount ecological problems of waste accumulation and disposal, the destruction of forests, and the mindless use of nonrenewable resources.	对陈龙斌而言，使用回收材料进行艺术创作突出了人类无休止的消费和浪费所带来的挑战，以及垃圾积累及处理、破坏森林和盲目使用不可再生资源所造成的巨大生态问题。
The reams of used computer paper disprove the assurance of the electronic paper-less office, which instead augments the use of paper, as printing is made much easier.	成堆的废旧电脑纸反驳了信誓旦旦的电子无纸化办公，由于打印变得更加便捷，这种做法反而增加了纸张使用。

However, it is not the book itself, but its educational heritage, literary importance, historical knowledge, and the sacredness of the written word that he treasures most.	然而，他最珍视的不是书籍本身，而是书的教育遗产、文学重要性、历史知识和文字的神圣性。
The type of materials he acquires in a sense determines the sculpture he creates.	他获得的材料类型在某种意义上决定了他创作的雕塑。
While in New York, he scoured the streets of Manhattan collecting discarded refuse, scouted offices for their rejected reams of paper, visited brownstone streets to gather cast off telephone books when new ones were distributed.	在纽约时，他在曼哈顿街头四处搜寻被人丢弃的垃圾，在办公室里寻找被人丢弃的成堆纸张，在分发新的电话簿时走访褐沙石街道，收集被人扔掉的电话簿。
And now, living in Taipei, Chen obtains his material from university libraries and bookstores, publishing companies, archeological museums, and telephone companies.	而现在，住在台北的陈先生从大学图书馆和书店、出版公司、考古博物馆以及电话公司获得自己的材料。

“I try to make sculptures that are appropriate for the content of the books.	“我尝试制作适合书籍内容的雕塑。
In my concept, the form and content is united together; the content gives me the idea of the form.	在我的理念中，形式和内容是结合在一起的；内容给了我关于形式的想法。

As early as the late Qing dynasty, many vendors were already selling beef slices served cold in the streets of Chengdu, using beef offal because they were relatively inexpensive.	早在清朝末年，许多小贩已在成都街头售卖牛肉片冷盘，因为牛下水价格相对便宜，所以用其制作冷盘。
Because of its low cost, the dish was popular among rickshaw pullers and poor students.	由于成本低，这道菜很受人力车夫和穷学生欢迎。
In the 1930s, a married couple in Chengdu became famous for making beef slices.	20 世纪 30 年代，成都有一对夫妻因制作牛肉片而出名。
The husband, Guo Zhaohua (郭朝華), and wife, Zhang Tianzheng (張田政), were particular about the beef slices they made, and often experimented with new ingredients.	丈夫郭朝华和妻子张田政对他们制作的牛肉片非常讲究，经常尝试新的原料。
As a result, their beef slices had a distinct taste from the other beef slice vendors, and their business boomed.	因此，他们的牛肉片与其他牛肉片商家的味道截然不同，生意也随之兴隆。

Later on, a merchant tried the fuqi feipian and was so satisfied, he gave them a gold-lettered plaque that read fuqi feipian, and the name has stuck ever since.	后来一位商人尝了夫妻肺片，非常满意，送给他们一块写着“夫妻肺片”的金字牌匾，从此这个名称就流传至今。
To suit their customers' tastes, the couple made many improvements on the dish, and offal slices were eventually replaced by various beef or lamb slices.	为了适应顾客的口味，这对夫妻对这道菜做了许多改进，内脏薄片最终被各种牛肉片或羊肉片所取代。
Many people still preferred calling the dish fuqi feipian, thus the name is still used today.	许多人仍然喜欢把这道菜称为“夫妻肺片”，因此这个名称至今依然在使用。
The meaning of fei was originally waste parts or offal (廢) but later changed to lung (肺) so the dish sounded less repulsive.	“废”的意思是废物或内脏，但后来改为“肺”，因此这道菜听起来不那么令人厌恶。
The lung could be a part of this offal, but fei is not lung by itself in this dish's meaning.	肺可以作为内脏的一部分，但在这道菜中并不是指“肺”。

For a time, Gulangyu had the peculiarity of having constituted the only international settlement on Chinese soil apart from the more celebrated International Settlement at Shanghai.	有一段时间，鼓浪屿的特殊性在于，它是中国境内除了更有名的上海公共租界之外唯一的公共租界。
Soon after Xiamen became a treaty port resulting from China's loss in the First Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, foreign residents on the island established an informal organization that became formally organized several decades later when its Land Regulations were approved by the government of China in May 1902.	由于中国在第一次鸦片战争中战败，1842 年签订南京条约，厦门在成为条约港口后不久，岛上的外国居民就建立了一个非正式组织，几十年后，《厦门鼓浪屿公共地界章程》于 1902 年 5 月获得中国政府批准，因而成为一个正式组织。
Eventually 13 countries, including Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Japan, were to enjoy extraterritorial privileges there and take part in the Kulangsu Municipal Council that administered the settlement.	最终，包括英、法、荷、日在内的 13 个国家将在此享有治外法权，并参与管理该租界的鼓浪屿市议会工作。
As with the Shanghai International Settlement, the British played a predominant role in the administration and Sikh policemen from British India were charged with the policing of the Settlement under the Kulangsu Municipal Police.	与上海公共租界一样，英国人在行政管理中发挥主导作用，来自英属印度的锡克族警察在鼓浪屿市警察的领导下，负责租界治安。
The consulates, churches, hospitals, schools, police stations, etc. built by those foreign communities explain the predominantly Victorian-era style architecture that can still be seen throughout Gulangyu.	由外国社区修建的领事馆、教堂、医院、学校、警察局等，形成了以维多利亚时代风格为主的建筑，在鼓浪屿上依然随处可见。
Japanese occupation of the island began in 1942, and lasted until the end of World War II.	日本占领该岛始于 1942 年，直至二战结束。
The Hokkien dialect is spoken on the island, as it is in Xiamen.	岛上说闽南语，与厦门一样。
After the establishment of the PRC, Gulangyu was a district of Xiamen, one of four in the municipality not located on Xiamen Island until 2003.	中华人民共和国成立后，鼓浪屿成为厦门的一个区，2003 年以前始终为不在厦门岛内的四个直辖地之一。
In May of that year Gulangyu District was absorbed into Siming District, and has since been administered, policed, and adjudicated from Xiamen Island, just across the Lujiang River.	那年 5 月，鼓浪屿区并入思明区，此后一直由鹭江对岸的厦门岛负责管理、治安和审判。
Gulangyu is unique in China as a "traffic-free island".	鼓浪屿作为“无车岛”，在中国独一无二。
It is connected to the main island of Xiamen only by ferry.	与厦门主岛仅由轮渡相连。
Neither cars nor bicycles are allowed, thus providing an alternative to the frenetic Xiamen Island across the river, although the recent introduction of electric tourist buggies may be damaging the island's charm.	这里既不允许开车，也不允许骑自行车，从而为河对岸狂热的厦门岛提供了另一种选择，但最近引进了电动旅游观光车可能会有损该岛的魅力。

Since then, the island's local cultural environment mingled with introduced foreign music and art, which is why the Gulangyu cultural scene differs from other parts of China.	从那时起，岛上的本土文化环境与引进的外国音乐和艺术相融合，这就是鼓浪屿的文化场景异于中国其他地方的原因。
A number of China's most famous classical musicians come from Gulangyu, including the pianist Yin Chengzong, the violist Jing Yang, and the pianist Xu Feiping.	中国一些最著名的古典音乐家均出自鼓浪屿，包括钢琴家殷承宗、小提琴家杨璟和钢琴家许斐平。

Duck has been roasted in China since the Southern and Northern Dynasties.	自南北朝以来，中国就有烤鸭。
A variation of roast duck was prepared for the Emperor of China in the Yuan dynasty.	元朝时，曾为中国皇帝制作过一种别样的烤鸭。
The dish, originally named "shāo yāzi" (燒鴨子), was mentioned in the Complete Recipes for Dishes and Beverages (飲膳正要) manual in 1330 by Hu Sihui (忽思慧), an inspector of the imperial kitchen.	这道菜原名“烧鸭子”，曾出现在饮膳太医忽思慧写于 1330 年的《饮膳正要》一书中。
The Peking Roast Duck that came to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming dynasty, and by then, Peking Duck was one of the main dishes on imperial court menus.	与这一称呼相联系的北京烤鸭在明朝后期得到充分发展，在那时，北京烤鸭已成为宫廷菜单上的主要菜肴之一。
The first restaurant specialising in Peking Duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, close to Qianmen of Beijing in 1416.	1416 年，第一家专门经营北京烤鸭的饭馆“便宜坊”在北京前门附近的鲜鱼口开张。
By the Qianlong Period (1736–1796) of the Qing dynasty, the popularity of Peking Duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring poetry from poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish.	到了清朝乾隆时期（1736-1796 年），北京烤鸭的人气蔓延到上层社会，喜欢这道菜的诗人、学者们纷纷写诗作赋。
For instance, one verse of Dūmén zhúzhīcí, a Beijing local poem was, "Fill your plates with roast duck and suckling pig".	例如，北京民间诗歌《都门竹枝词》之一写道，“烤鸭乳猪列满盘”。
In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing.	1864 年，全聚德在北京创建。
Yang Quanren (楊全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks.	全聚德的创始人杨全仁开发了烤鸭用的吊炉。
With its innovations and efficient management, the restaurant became well known in China, introducing the Peking Duck to the rest of the world.	凭借创新及高效管理，这家饭店在中国广为人知，把北京烤鸭介绍到了世界各地。
By the mid-20th century, Peking Duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike.	至 20 世纪中期，北京烤鸭已成为中国的一种国家象征，受到游客和外交官青睐。
For example, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, during his first (secret) visit to China.	例如，美国国务卿基辛格首次（秘密）访华时，于 1971 年 7 月 10 日在人民大会堂与周恩来总理会面。
After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite.	在上午进行了一轮无结果的会谈后，代表团享用北京烤鸭作为午餐，这成了基辛格的最爱。
The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972.	美中双方次日发表一份联合声明，邀请尼克松总统于 1972 年访问中国。
Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking Duck.	1976 年周恩来去世后，基辛格再次访问北京，品尝北京烤鸭。

Two notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become household names, each with their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique of closed oven roasting.	在北京供应这道菜的两家饭店是全聚德和便宜坊，这两家都是百年老店，家喻户晓，各有风格：全聚德以挂炉烤制法而闻名，而便宜坊则采用最古老的焖炉烤法。
Fattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, eviscerated and rinsed thoroughly with water.	肥鸭经宰杀、去毛、开膛破肚，并用水彻底冲洗。
Air is pumped under the skin through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat.	通过鸭子颈部的洞向皮下灌入空气，使皮与脂肪分离。
The duck is then plunged in boiling water for 1 to 5 minutes, and then hung to dry.	然后将鸭子在沸水中浸 1 至 5 分钟，随后悬挂晾干。
This will tighten the skin and help the duck to achieve its traditional crispy texture.	这样可以收紧表皮，有助于鸭子达到传统的酥脆质地。
The duck is then glazed with a layer of potentially spiced and flavored maltose syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water.	然后给鸭子涂上一层可能添加了香料和调味品的麦芽糖浆，内部再次用水冲洗一遍。
A marinade of traditional flavorings, including soy sauce and five-spice powder, and more maltose, is then applied inside the body cavity.	然后在鸭子体内抹上传统风味的腌料，其中包括酱油、五香粉和更多麦芽糖。
This will flavor the duck during the next step.	这会在下一步骤中给鸭子增添风味。
The duck is then left to dry for between 24 hours and several days in a cool, dry place (or a refrigerator).	之后，将鸭子放在阴凉干燥的地方（或冰箱）晾 24 小时至数天。
The drying allows the skin to crisp while roasting.	风干可以使表皮在烘烤时变脆。
It is then roasted in an oven until the skin turns shiny brown.	然后在炉中烘烤，直至表皮变成带有光泽的棕色。
While roasting, hot water is added to the body cavity as needed to ensure even cooking and tenderness.	烤制时，根据需要向鸭子体腔内加热水，以确保均匀受热，肉质鲜嫩。
Some preparations involve the duck being smoked with fruity woods.	有些做法是用果木熏制鸭子。
Besides traditional methods to prepare Peking Duck, recipes have been compiled by chefs around the world to produce the dish at home.	除了制作北京烤鸭的传统方法外，世界各地的厨师们还编写了这道菜的家常做法。
Peking duck is originally roasted in a closed oven (Chinese: 焖炉), and Bianyifang is the restaurant that keeps this tradition.	北京烤鸭最初是在焖炉里烤制，便宜坊是保留这一传统做法的饭店。

The oven is preheated by burning Gaoliang sorghum straw (Chinese: 秫秸; pinyin: shú jiē) at the base.	通过在炉底燃烧秫秸来给炉子预热。
The duck is placed in the oven immediately after the fire burns out, allowing the meat to be slowly cooked through the convection of heat within the oven.	火熄灭后，立即把鸭子放进烤炉，通过烤炉内的热量对流慢慢把肉烤熟。
Controlling the fuel and the temperature is the main skill.	控制燃料和温度是主要技巧。
In closed-oven style, duck meat is combined well with the fat under the skin, and therefore is juicy and tender.	在焖炉烤法中，鸭肉与皮下脂肪完美结合，因此鲜嫩多汁。
The open oven (Chinese: 挂炉; literally: 'hung oven') was developed in the imperial kitchens during the Qing Dynasty, and adopted by the Quanjude restaurant chain.	挂炉在清朝御膳房中发展起来，为全聚德连锁饭店所采用。
It is designed to roast up to 20 ducks at the same time with an open fire fueled by hardwood from peach or pear trees.	其设计为使用桃木或梨木等硬木明火烤制，可同时烤 20 只鸭子。
The ducks are hung on hooks above the fire and roasted at a temperature of 270 °C (525 °F) for 30–40 minutes.	鸭子挂在火堆上方的钩子上，以 270 ℃（525 ℉）烤 30-40 分钟。
While the ducks are roasting, the chef may use a pole to dangle each duck closer to the fire for 30-second intervals.	烤制鸭子时，厨师可以用一根杆子把每只鸭子吊到靠近炉火的位置，间隔 30 秒。
In open-oven style, the fat is usually melted during the cooking process, so the skin is crispy, and can be eaten separately as a snack.	在吊炉烤法中，脂肪通常已在烹调过程中融化，因此皮很脆，可以作为小吃单独食用。
Almost every part of a duck can be prepared afterwards.	鸭子几乎所有部位都可用于制作后续菜肴。
Quanjude Restaurant served their customers the "All Duck Banquet" in which they cooked the bones of ducks with vegetables.	全聚德餐厅为顾客提供“全鸭宴”，将鸭骨与蔬菜一起制成菜肴。

The meat together with bones can also be stir-fried with sweet bean sauce, or rapidly sautéed and served with salt and Sichuan pepper (椒鹽).	肉和骨头也可以用甜面酱来炒，或快速翻炒，然后蘸椒盐食用。
Otherwise, they are packed up to be taken home by the customers.	或者，打包后由顾客带回家。
Whole Peking Ducks can be ordered as takeaways.	整只北京烤鸭可以外卖订购。
The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil.	可以用烤箱、烤架或滚油，在家重新加热鸭子。
When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a temperature of 150 °C (300 °F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160 °C (325 °F) for another 10 minutes.	使用烤箱时，先用 150 ℃（300 ℉）给鸭子加热 20 分钟，然后再用 160 ℃（325 ℉）加热 10 分钟。
The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70 cm (28 in) above the cooking fire.	烧烤法是在鸭子中放满沸水，然后将其放置在离火 70 厘米（28 英寸）的烤盘上。
The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot.	每隔 3-4 分钟更换一次沸水，直到鸭子表皮变得滚烫。

A large dam across the Yangtze River was originally envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919.	1919 年，孙中山在《实业计划》中最早提出修建一座横跨长江的大坝的设想。
He stated that a dam capable of generating 30 million horsepower (22 GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges.	他认为，有可能在三峡下游修建一座发电量为 3000 万马力（22 吉瓦）的大坝。
In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on plans in the Three Gorges.	1932 年，蒋介石领导的国民党政府开始进行三峡工程的初步规划。
In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area.	1939 年，日本军队占领宜昌并对该地区进行勘测。
A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam in anticipation of a Japanese victory over China.	在预期日本对中国取得胜利的情况下，完成了一份大坝设计，即大谷（音译）计划。
In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation head design engineer, John L. Savage, surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'.	1944 年，美国垦务局设计总工程师萨凡奇实地勘测这一地区，为“扬子江工程”拟定了一份大坝方案。
Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training.	约 54 名中国工程师被派往美国参加培训。
The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next.	最初的计划要求大坝采用一种独特的方法来移动船只；船只进入位于大坝底部和顶部的水闸，然后用电缆吊车将船只从一个水闸移到下一个水闸。
In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency.	对于较小的船只，为提高效率起见，将多组船只一同吊起。
It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods.	尚不清楚这一解决方案是考虑到能够节水，还是因为工程师认为大坝上下江面高度差太大而无法采用其他方法。
Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, in the midst of the Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.	虽然已经完成了一些勘探、测绘、经济研究和设计工作，但由于国共内战，政府于 1947 年停止了这项工作。
After the 1949 Communist takeover, Mao Zedong supported the project, but began the Gezhouba Dam project nearby first, and economic problems including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution slowed progress.	1949 年中国共产党接管政权后，毛泽东支持这个项目，首先在附近开建葛洲坝工程，包括大跃进和文化大革命在内的经济问题使进展缓慢。
After the 1954 Yangtze River Floods, in 1956, Mao Zedong authored "Swimming", a poem about his fascination with a dam on the Yangtze River.	1954 年长江洪水之后，毛泽东于 1956 年创作了诗歌《水调歌头·游泳》，表达了他对在长江上修建一座大坝的强烈意愿。
In 1958, after the Hundred Flowers Campaign, some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned.	1958 年，在“百花齐放”整风运动之后，一些公开反对这项工程的工程师被关进监狱。
During the 1980s, the idea of a dam reemerged.	20 世纪 80 年代，修建大坝的想法再次出现。
The National People's Congress approved the dam in 1992: out of 2,633 delegates, 1,767 voted in favour, 177 voted against, 664 abstained, and 25 members did not vote.	1992 年全国人民代表大会批准修建大坝：在 2633 名代表中，1767 票赞成，177 票反对，664 票弃权，还有 25 人未投票。
Construction started on December 14, 1994. The dam was expected to be fully operational in 2009, but additional projects, such as the underground power plant with six additional generators, delayed full operation until May 2012.	工程于 1994 年 12 月 14 日动工。预计大坝将于 2009 年全面投入运营，但其他项目（例如配备 6 台发电机的地下发电厂）的全面运营推迟至 2012 年 5 月。

The government estimated that the Three Gorges Dam project would cost 180 billion yuan (US$22.5 billion).	政府预估三峡大坝工程将耗资 1800 亿元人民币（225 亿美元）。
By the end of 2008, spending had reached 148.365 billion yuan, among which 64.613 billion yuan was spent on construction, 68.557 billion yuan on relocating affected residents, and 15.195 billion yuan on financing.	截至 2008 年底，支出已达 1483.65 亿元人民币，其中建设支出 646.13 亿元，居民搬迁安置支出 685.57 亿元，融资支出 151.95 亿元。
It was estimated in 2009 that the construction cost would be recovered when the dam had generated 1,000 terawatt-hours (3,600 PJ) of electricity, yielding 250 billion yuan.	据估计 2009 年就可收回建设成本，届时大坝发电 1000 太瓦时（3600 拍焦），收益 2500 亿元人民币。
Full cost recovery was thus expected to occur ten years after the dam started full operation, but the full cost of the Three Gorges Dam was recovered by December 20, 2013.	因此，预计将在三峡大坝全面运行十年后收回全部成本，但到 2013 年 12 月 20 日，三峡大坝已收回全部成本。
Funding sources include the Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund, profits from the Gezhouba Dam, loans from the China Development Bank, loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks, corporate bonds, and revenue from both before and after the dam is fully operational.	资金来源包括三峡大坝建设基金、葛洲坝的利润、国家开发银行贷款、国内外商业银行贷款、公司债券以及大坝全面运行前后的收入。

About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5 tonnes of solid waste every day.	增加了大约 32个垃圾填埋场，每天可处理 7664.5 吨固体垃圾。
Over one billion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which was more likely to be swept away before the reservoir was created.	每年有超过 10 亿吨废水排放到河流中，这些废水在水库建成之前更有可能被冲走。
This has left the water looking stagnant, polluted and murky.	使河水看起来死气沉沉，污染严重，浑浊不堪。
In 1997, the Three Gorges area had 10% forestation, down from 20% in the 1950s.	1997 年，三峡地区绿化面积从 20 世纪 50 年代的 20% 降至 10%。
Research by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization suggested that the Asia-Pacific region would, overall, gain about 6,000 km² (2,300 sq mi) of forest by 2008.	联合国粮农组织的研究表明，到 2008 年，亚太地区森林总面积将增加约 6000 平方公里（2300 平方英里）。
That is a significant change from the 13,000 km² (5,000 sq mi) net loss of forest each year in the 1990s.	这与 20 世纪 90 年代每年净损失 13000 平方公里（5000 平方英里）森林相比，变化显著。
This is largely due to China's large reforestation effort.	这主要是由于中国大规模的植树造林工作。
This accelerated after the 1998 Yangtze River floods convinced the government that it must restore tree cover, especially in the Yangtze's basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.	这一趋势在 1998 年长江洪水之后得到加速，这场大洪水使政府确信必须恢复树木覆盖，尤其是在三峡大坝上游长江流域。
In 2010, NASA scientists calculated that shift of water mass stored by the dams would increase the length of the Earth's day by 0.06 microseconds and make the Earth slightly more round in the middle and flat on the poles.	2010 年，美国国家航空航天局（NASA）科学家计算得出，大坝储水量变化将使地球白天的长度增加 0.06 微秒，并使地球中间略圆，两极略平。
An important function of the dam is to control flooding, which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze.	大坝的一大作用是控制洪水，这是长江作为季节性河流的一个主要问题。
Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai situated adjacent to the river.	数百万人生活在大坝下游，武汉、南京和上海等许多重要的大城市都毗邻长江河道。
Plenty of farm land and China's most important industrial area are built beside the river.	大量农田和中国最重要的工业区都沿江而建。
The reservoir's flood storage capacity is 22 cubic kilometres (5.3 cu mi; 18,000,000 acre⋅ft).	水库蓄洪能力为 22 立方公里 （5.3 立方英里；1800 万英亩英尺）。
This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every 10 years to once every 100 years.	这一能力将使下游发生大洪水的频率从十年一遇降至百年一遇。
The dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a "super" flood.	预计大坝将尽可能减小哪怕是“超级”洪水的影响。

During a media interview at a promotional event for the KO One Re-act television series, Wang reiterated his thanks for fans' warm support.	不巧的是，因自己目前身在剧组，还有拍摄工作尚未完成，不能因为自己而影响到整个剧组的拍摄计划和进度，所以只能无奈放弃此次培训机会。”在电视剧《终极一班 3》的宣传活动中接受采访时，汪东城再次表达了对粉丝们热情支持的感谢。

Shanghai is officially abbreviated 沪 (Hù/Vu²) in Chinese, a contraction of 沪渎 (Hù Dú/Vu Doh, lit "Harpoon Ditch"), a 4th- or 5th-century Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean.	上海在汉语里的正式缩写是“沪”（Hù/Vu²），是“沪渎“（Hù Dú/Vu Doh，字面意思“鱼叉沟”）的缩约形式，这是 4 世纪或 5 世纪时晋朝对苏州河口的叫法，当时苏州河是主要的入海渠道。

Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.	学者们从理论上认为，这可能反映了该镇的经济重要性，而非较低的政治地位。
During the Qing dynasty, Shanghai became one of the most important sea ports in the Yangtze Delta region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the Kangxi Emperor reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels—a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the Qianlong Emperor moved the customs office for Jiangsu province (江海关; see Customs House, Shanghai) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade.	清朝年间，由于中央政府两项重要的政策变化，上海成为长江三角洲地区最重要的港口之一：1684 年，康熙皇帝推翻了明朝自 1525 年起实施的禁海令；1732 年，乾隆皇帝将江苏海关“江海关”（参见"上海海关"）从首府松江迁至上海，并给予上海对江苏外贸的海关征收独家管理权。
As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.	由于这两项重要决策，到 1735 年，上海成为整个长江下游地区的主要贸易港口，尽管在政治阶层中仍处于最低的行政级别。

The Treaty of the Bogue, the Treaty of Wanghia, and the Treaty of Whampoa (signed in 1843, 1844, and 1844, respectively) forced Chinese concession to European and American desires for visitation and trade on Chinese soil.	《虎门条约》、《望厦条约》和《黄埔条约》（分别于 1843 年、1844 年和 1844 年签署）迫使中国对欧洲和美国访问及占用中国领土的愿望做出妥协。

The French opted out of the Shanghai Municipal Council and maintained its own concession to the south and southwest.	法国退出了上海公共租界工部局，但仍保留其对南部和西南部的特许权。
