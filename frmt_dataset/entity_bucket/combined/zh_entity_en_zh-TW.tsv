However, the percentage of consumer offerings was likely lower as passenger car counts may include microvans, tiny commercial vehicles that are popular in China.	但該客用產品占比可能高估，因為數字可能包括在中國的熱門車種廂型小車和小型商用車。
Between 1978-1985 alongside the market-based Chinese economic reforms instituted by Deng Xiaoping, Dongfeng was transformed from a manufacturer of two heavy-duty trucks with fragmented operations and ownership into a single, centrally managed enterprise.	在 1978－1985 年鄧小平推動的中國市場經濟改革中，東風從營運和所有權混亂的兩款重型卡車製造廠，轉變成單一、中央管控的企業。

Post-1985, further reforms took place that allowed Dongfeng greater autonomy; the company was removed from the direct administrative control of the central government.	1985 年後發動更大的改革，使東風更能自主；該公司不再受中央政府直接管理。
By the mid-1980s, its assets had tripled from those initially given to it by the state in 1981, and management was desirous of even greater production capacity.	1980 年代中期，和 1981 年國家撥付的資產相比增為三倍，管理層也想要將產量再次擴大。
But in 1995, the company was experiencing financial difficulties as was the case with many Chinese automobile manufacturers at this time.	但於 1995 年，該公司和許多中國的汽車公司相同，都發生財務困難。
The situation was still dire in 1998 precipitating a 1999 restructuring of the company.	慘況持續到 1998 年，導致該公司於 1999 年進行重整。
This state owned enterprise has come into conflict with authority at both the national and provincial levels.	國營企業面對國家與省級政府時會有衝突。

As Tu also presented at the project seminar, its preparation was described in a 1,600-year-old text, in a recipe titled, "Emergency Prescriptions Kept Up One's Sleeve".	屠在計畫研討會上演說時，有人說她的演說就像 1,600 年一本醫書的標題「肘後備急方」的標題一樣。
At first, it was ineffective because they extracted it with traditional boiling water.	一開始，因為團隊以傳統滾水法來萃取，因此無效。
Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant; Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source, The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments, written in 340 by Ge Hong, which states that this herb should be steeped in cold water.	屠呦呦發現，以低溫萃取程序，可以從植物中分離出有效的抗瘧成分；屠說，這是受到由葛洪於西元 340 年撰寫的傳統草藥緊急處方醫書的影響，書中說這種草藥必須以冷水浸泡。
This book contained the direction to immerse a handful of qinghao in the equivalent of two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all.	該書中的處方指出，以一把青蒿泡在約 2 公升水中，擰出汁液並全部飲下。
After rereading the recipe, Tu realised the hot water had already damaged the active ingredient in the plant; therefore she proposed a method using low-temperature ether to extract the effective compound instead.	讀過這個處方後，屠了解到熱水會破壞該植物的有效成分，因此她提議替代方案，以低溫乙醚來萃取出有效成分。
The animal tests showed it was completely effective in mice and monkeys.	以老鼠和猴子進行的動物測試，證明這種方法完全有效。

Tu's group first determined the chemical structure of artemisinin.	屠的團隊首度確定了青蒿素的化學結構。
In 1973, Tu wanted to confirm the carbonyl group in the artemisinin molecule, therefore she accidentally synthesized dihydroartemisinin.	1973 年，屠想要確認青蒿素分子中的羰基團，因此在無意間合成雙氫青素。
Furthermore, Tu volunteered to be the first human subject.	此外，屠也志願當做人體實驗第一名受試者。
"As head of this research group, I had the responsibility" she said.	她說，「身為研究團隊之首，我責無旁貸。」
It was safe, so she conducted successful clinical trials with human patients.	新藥是安全的，因此她也成功完成新藥的病患治療試驗。

Tu is regarded as the "Three-Without Scientist" – no postgraduate degree (there was no postgraduate education then in China), no study or research experience abroad, and not a member of either the Chinese national academies, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering.	屠被稱為「三無科學家」－沒有博士學位（當時中國沒有博士學程）、未曾出國深造，也不是任何中國國家級研究機構的成員，如中國科學院或中國工程院院士。

The airport was built in 1936 during Japanese rule with its origins as a Japanese military airbase, the Taihoku Airfield (Japanese: 臺北飛行場 Hepburn: Taihoku Hikōjō), also known as Matsuyama Airfield (松山飛行場).	本機場建於1936年的日本統治時期，原為日本空軍機場，當時稱為台北飛行場，又稱松山飛行場。
After World War II, in 1946, it was taken over by the Republic of China Air Force.	二次世界大戰之後的1946年，由中華民國空軍取得。
Before the end of the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the airport provided flight routes between Shanghai and Taipei, occasionally via Fuzhou.	在中國內戰結束、中華人民共和國政府成立之前，該機場提供台北上海航線，有時也飛往福州。
Shared military and civilian use—both domestic and international—began on 16 April 1950 in the reconstructed Civil Aeronautics Administration Taipei Airport (交通部民用航空局台北航空站).	1950年4月16日起，改組的交通部民用航空局台北航空站，將該機場設為軍事與民航兩用， 包括國內與國際航線。
Domestic destinations have been Kaohsiung, Hualien, Taichung, Penghu, and Tainan.	國內航線曾包括高雄、花蓮、台中、澎湖與台南航線。
The first international destinations were Seattle, Tokyo, Pusan, Manila, Bangkok, and Hong Kong.	最初開始飛行的國際航線包括西雅圖、 東京、釜山、馬尼拉、曼谷、香港。
The first international airlines included Northwest Airlines, Pan American Airlines, and Hong Kong Airways (now Cathay Pacific).	最初的國際航空公司包括西北航空、泛美航空、香港航空（現在的國泰航空）。
Later, the airport became too small to handle an increased number of passengers, even after a series of expansions.	之後， 即使在歷經幾次擴建之後， 該機場還是太小而無法容納增加的旅客。
This later worsened when new wide-body jets became common at the airport.	之後該機場的廣體客機增加， 情況更為惡化。
Therefore, all international activities were relocated to Taoyuan International Airport (then known as Chiang Kai-shek International) after its inauguration on 26 February 1979.	因此，所有國際航班都轉移到於1979年2月26日啟用的桃園國際機場（當時稱做中正國際機場）。
Consequently, the passenger load at the airport dropped from 6.2 million in 1978 to 2.9 million in 1979 (a 53% decrease).	此後該機場的乘客容量從1978年的6,200,000人，降到1979年的2,900,000人（下降53%）。
At its peak in 1997, the airport handled over 15.3 million passengers annually.	1997年該機場的乘客人數達到高峰， 一年超過1,530萬人。
Service to Taichung and Chiayi was stopped in mid-2007 after the load factor dropped significantly due to Taiwan High Speed Rail start of revenue service in January 2007.	2007年1月台灣高鐵開始商業營運之後，由於往台中與嘉義的乘客人數大幅下降，這兩條航線於2007年中停止服務。
Passenger volume decreased from 6.7 million in 2006 to 4.4 million in 2007 (a 34% decrease).	乘客人數自2006年的6,700,000下降到2007年的4,400,000（下降34%）。
Also due to the opening of the high speed rail line, on 1 March 2008, Uni Air suspended its service to Kaohsiung, while Far Eastern Air Transport suspended its service to Tainan.	同時在高鐵開始營運的影響下， 2008年3月1日起，立榮航空停止飛往高雄的服務，遠東航空則停止飛往台南的服務。
TransAsia Airways decided to stop flights to Tainan and Kaohsiung after 1 August 2008.	復興航空則決定自2008年8月1日起，停止飛航台南與高雄。
In early 1999 when the construction of Taipei 101 had just started, Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration changed this airport's certain SID and STAR procedures to avoid possible collision with the building.	1999年初當台北101開始興建時，台灣民用航空局改變機場的某些 SID 與 STAR 程序， 避免可能的撞擊事件。
The 677-meter Fuxing North Road Underground Passage (復興北路車行地下道) was constructed between 1997 and 2006 under this airport's runway to link the north and south side of this airport.	677公尺長的復興北路車行地下道，於1997到2006年之間在機場跑道下方施工，以聯通該機場的南端和北端。

Then-mayor Ma Ying-jeou had been pressing to make Songshan Airport Taipei's main International terminal, citing that its location close to the city center would make it preferable for business travelers.	剈市長馬英九曾經推動松山機場成為台北主要的國際機場，因為該機場靠近台北市中心，對商務旅客來說非常方便。
However, building height restrictions around the airport raised concerns about flight safety, blocking of radio communications, noise pollution, and a reduced number of flights.	然而， 機場附近的建築線高造成諸如飛航安全問題、 無線電通訊阻擾、 噪音污染， 必須減少航班。
The continuing growth of Taipei City means that Songshan airport is situated in the heart of downtown Taipei.	台北市區的不斷成長，也使得松山機場所在地變成台北市中心區域。
Compared to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Songshan Airport saves travelers about 30 minutes due to its location inside Taipei City's central business district, but the city suffers from the noise, pollution, restrictions on urban planning, and traffic congestion the airport brings about.	和台灣桃園國際機場相比，松山機場讓旅客節省約30分鐘，因為他就正在市區正中心的商業區；但是機場也為台北市帶來噪音、污染、 都市計劃限制和交通擁擠等問題。
In the 2002 and 2006 Taipei Mayor Election DPP candidates Lee Ying-yuan and Frank Hsieh both proposed the plan to close Songshan Airport, and developed its land into road, huge park, detention basin and sports arena, since the Taiwan High Speed Rail could quickly take up the traffic load between Taipei and western Taiwan cities, and the remaining service to outlying islands and eastern Taiwan could be easily taken over by the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport after the completion of Taoyuan International Airport Access MRT System by the end of 2016.	2002年與2006年，民進黨的台北市長候選人李應元與謝長廷，兩人都主張關閉松山機場，將其用地發展為道路、大型公園、 滯洪池與運動區， 因為台灣高鐵可以快速承擔台北到其他台灣西部城市的交通，而在桃園國際機場捷運在2016年底完成之後，松山機場剩餘的功能，包括飛往離島與台灣東部，可以由台灣桃園國際機場取代。
Also, the MRT system will make the international potential of Songshan airport less attractive.	同時，機場捷運也會讓松山機場的國際航線功能變得比較沒有吸引力。
The Songshan Airport closing proposal was deferred under the Taipei City Government which has long been dominated by the Pan-Blue Coalition, who prefers the downtown airport connection concept with Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo.	長期由泛藍陣營執政的台北市政府，則反對關閉松山機場的提案， 他們比較偏好以市區機場連接上海、首爾、東京的構想。
Due to the introduction of Taiwan-China flights and future international potential, the airport is undergoing extensive renovations, the first phase of which is expected to be completed by October 2010.	由於導入台灣中國直飛航線以及未來國際航線的需求，該機場正在進行大規模的改建，第一期預計在2010年10月前完成。

On 29 March 2011, the renovated Terminal 2 was re-opened to handle domestic flights.	2011年3月29日，重新改建的第二航廈重新開幕，供國內航線使用。
Songshan Airport is seen to have the potential to attract business travelers within Pacific Asia due to its location in downtown Taipei.	松山機場因為位於台北市區，對於亞太區的商務旅客相當有吸引力。
Flights to Bangkok–Don Mueang, Jakarta–Halim Perdanakusuma, Kuala Lumpur–Subang, Singapore–Seletar, Nagoya–Komaki, Osaka–Itami, Seoul–Gimpo, Shanghai–Hongqiao, Beijing–Nanyuan, and Tokyo–Haneda are especially attractive since these airports are also in the central areas of their respective cities, and all these cities have larger far flung international airports.	飛往曼谷廊曼、 雅加達哈林帕達納克蘇瑪國際機場、吉隆坡梳邦機場、 新加坡實里達機場、 名古屋小牧機場、 大阪伊丹機場、 首爾金浦機場、上海虹橋機場，北京南苑機場、東京羽田機場的航班特別受歡迎， 因為這些機場都位在市中心， 在較遠的郊區有更大的國際機場。

In the aftermath of the Japanese threat, Qing viceroy Li Hongzhang visited Moscow in 1896 and signed a secret treaty with Russian foreign minister Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, allowing Imperial Russia to build a Russian gauge railway in Manchuria, which opened the door towards further Russian expansionism in the form of another lease convention in 1898, effectively allowing Russia to annex Port Arthur in all but name.	在日本威脅之後，清朝總督李鴻章於1896年訪問了莫斯科，並與俄羅斯外交部長阿列克謝・洛巴諾夫-羅斯托夫斯基簽署密約，允許俄羅斯帝國在滿洲建造一條俄羅斯軌距鐵路，這為1898年以另一項租賃公約的形式進一步的俄羅斯擴張主義打開了大門，讓俄羅斯除了名義上以外，完全有效吞併旅順口區。
However, after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Russian forces used the anti-foreigner insurgency as a pretext to formally invade and occupied most of Manchuria, and Mukden became a Russian stronghold in the Far East with the building of the South Manchurian Railway.	然而，1900年義和團之亂後，俄羅斯軍隊以對抗外國入侵為藉口，正式入侵佔領了滿洲大部分地區，隨著南滿鐵路的建設， 瀋陽成為俄羅斯在遠東的據點。

British and US reports indicate that the Soviet troops that occupied Northeast China and Eastern Inner Mongolia region looted and terrorized the people of Shenyang, and were not discouraged by Soviet authorities from "three days of rape and pillage".	英國和美國的報告指出，佔領東北和內蒙古東部地區的蘇聯軍隊，對 瀋陽居民進行搶劫和恐嚇，蘇聯當局沒有阻止連續「三天的強姦掠奪」。
The Soviets were replaced by the Nationalist Chinese, who were flown in on U.S. transport planes.	蘇聯被乘坐美國運輸機的國民黨軍取代。
During the Chinese Civil War, Shenyang remained a Kuomintang stronghold from 1946 to 1948, although the Chinese communists controlled the surrounding countryside.	在中國內戰期間，瀋陽從1946年到1948年一直是國民黨的據點，不過中國共產黨控制了周圍的農村。
It was captured by the communists on October 30, 1948, following a series of offensives known as the Liaoshen Campaign.	在一連串稱作遼西會戰的攻擊後，共產黨於1948年10月30日佔領瀋陽。
Over the past 200 years or so, Shenyang managed to grow and increase its industrial might, despite consecutive wars with Russia and Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Second World War, and China's Civil War (Shenyang became the main battleground between the Communists and Nationalists).	在過去的200年左右的時間裡，儘管在19世紀末和20世紀初與俄羅斯和日本連續發生戰爭，又歷娙第二次世界大戰和中國內戰（瀋陽成為共產黨和國民黨間的主要戰場），瀋陽還是設法增長並強化其工業實力。
The old city of Shenyang resided almost entirely within the modern day Shenhe District, and used to have two city walls.	瀋陽舊城幾乎完全居於在當代的瀋河區，曾有兩道城牆。
Situated roughly within the area bounded by the four "Shuncheng" (顺城; 'along the city walls') roads/streets in Shenhe District, the (now-demolished) square-shaped inner city wall marked the bounds of ancient Shenyang.	（現已拆除的）方形內城牆，大致位於瀋河區四條「順城」道路/街道的範圍內，代表著舊時瀋陽的邊界。
The earliest wall was built in 926 during early Liao dynasty to settle Northern Song civilians the Khitans abducted from raids to use as slave labourers, and was then made of rammed earth because the city was merely a small settlement at the time (historically the administrative center of the Liaodong region was at Liaoyang).	最早的城牆建於926年，在遼朝早期，用於安置由契丹人突襲中綁架而來的北宋居民，用作奴工；城牆由夯土製成，因為當時這座城市只是一個小據點（歷史上，遼東地區的行政中心在遼陽）。
However, in 1368, Hongwu Emperor of the newly founded Ming dynasty ordered a new regional military command—the Liaodong Regional Military Commission (遼東都指揮使司)—to be established, and Shenyang was made a prominent regional "guard town" (衛所).	然而，1368年，新建國的明朝洪武皇帝，下令成立一個新的地區軍事指揮部——遼東都指揮使司，瀋陽成為一個著名的區域衛所。
In 1388, Min Zhong (閔忠), the newly appointed city commissioner of the Shenyang Central Guard, wrote to Hongwu Emperor immediately upon his tenure requesting permission to upgrade the city wall, and the old wall was made taller and thoroughly reinforced with overlaid bricks.	1388年，瀋陽中央衛隊新任命的行政首長閔忠，在上任後立即上書給洪武皇帝，請求准許升級城牆，舊城牆變得更高，並以磚塊覆蓋徹底加固。
According to History of Ming, the reconstructed Ming-era wall was 2.5 zhàngs (8 metres or 26 feet) tall, more than 1 zhàng (3.2 metres or 10.5 feet) wide at the top, and 9 lis and 30 bus (about 5.2 kilometres or 3.2 miles) long.	根據明朝歷史，重建的明代城牆高2.5丈（8米或26英尺），頂部寬超過1丈（3.2米或10.5英尺），長9里和30步（約5.2公里或3.2英里）。
It has two layers of moats dug outside, each being 3 zhàngs (9.6 metres or 31.5 feet) wide and 8 chis (2.56 metres or 8 feet 4.8 inches) deep, fed with water from Shen River.	城外挖了兩層護城河，每層寬3丈（9.6米或31.5英尺），深8丈（2.56米或8英尺4.8英寸），灌入瀋河的水。
There were four city gates, each at the center of one side, connected by two main roads that intersected at Central Temple of the city's center in a "+" fashion.	有四個城門，每道城門都在一邊的中心點，由兩條主要道路相連；兩條主要道路以「+」的方式在市中心的中央寺廟交會。
This Ming wall was heavily damaged in 1625 after the Manchu laid siege and captured the city, with only the north wall and gate (which had undergone reinforcing reconstructions in 1545 under the orders of Jiajing Emperor) remained intact.	1625年滿洲人包圍並佔領該市後，這堵明城牆嚴重受損，只有北牆和大門（在嘉靖皇帝命令下，在1545年進行強化重建）完好無損。
The Manchu leader Nurhachi however saw the strategic value of the city, and decided to formally relocate his Later Jin capital from Liaoyang to Shenyang, and ordered the city wall to be rebuilt.	然而，滿族領袖努爾哈赤看出這座城市的戰略價值，決定將金朝首都從遼陽正式遷至瀋陽，並下令重建城牆。
According to Annals of Mukden (盛京通志), the new city wall was a standard black brick wall standing at a height of 3.5 zhàngs (about 12.5 metres or 41.0 feet), a width of 1.8 zhàngs (about 6.4 metres or 21.0 feet) and a total length of 9 lis and 332 bus (about 6.4 kilometres or 4.0 miles) long, complete with 12 towers (8 gate and 4 corner) and a 14.5 zhàngs (about 52-metre or 171-foot) wide moat.	根據《盛京通志》，新城牆是一堵標準的黑磚牆，高度為3.5 丈（約12.5米或41.0英尺），寬度為1.8 丈（約6.4米或21.0英尺），總長度為9 里 332 步（約6.4公里或4.0英里），配有12座塔樓（8個大門和4個角落），護城河寬 14.5 丈（約52米或171英尺）。
The city gates were increased from four to eight, though the old Ming-era north gate and tower was preserved but sealed shut, later known as the "Ninth Gate" (九門).	後城門從四個增加到八個，儘管古老的明時代北門和塔樓保留下來，但密封關閉，後來稱為「九門」。
The outer city wall, called the "peripheral wall" (邊牆; Biān Qiáng) or "pass wall" (關牆; Guān Qiáng), was actually a rammed earth rampart built in 1680 to expand the urban area outside the inner city.	外城牆稱為「邊牆」或「關牆」，實際上是一座建於1680年的夯土牆，旨在將城區擴及內城之外。
It was almost round in shape, standing at a height of 7.5 chis (around 2.7 metres or 8 feet 10.3 inches) and an overall length of 32 lis and 24 bus (about 20.7 kilometres or 12.9 miles), and also had eight gates known as the "peripheral gates" (邊門; Biān Mén).	它大致是圓形的，高度為7.5尺（約2.7米或8英尺10.3英寸），總長度為32英里24步（約20.7公里或12.9英里），還有8個被稱為「邊門」。
The corresponding inner and outer gates were linked by roads that intersected within the inner city in a "#" pattern around the Mukden Palace.	對應的內門和外門之間，連結有在城內交叉的道路，在瀋陽故宮周圍以「#」圖案交叉。
Nearly all of these city walls and gates were demolished after 1949.	所有的城牆和城門，在1949年後幾乎都被摧毁。
Two gates and one corner tower of the inner wall were rebuilt during the 1990s.	1990年代， 內城牆有兩個城門和一個角落的塔樓重建起來。
There had, however, been proposals to rebuild the other gates and towers in preparation to the 12th National Games in 2013.	然而，有人提議重建其他大門和塔樓，為2013年 中華人民共和國第12屆運動會做準備。
Around 2.5 km (1.6 mi) outside Shenyang's former outer wall, there were four pagodas each located within an associated Tibetan buddhist temple, namely the East Pagoda in Yongguang Temple (永光寺), the South Pagoda in Guangci Temple (廣慈寺), the West Pagoda in Yanshou Temple (延壽寺) and the North Pagoda in Falun Temple (法輪寺).	在瀋陽舊外牆外約2.5公里（1.6英里），有四座寶塔，各自位於相關的藏傳佛教寺內，即永光寺的東塔、廣慈寺的南塔、延壽寺的西塔和法輪寺的北塔。
They were built in 1643 and completed in 1645.	這些寶塔於1643年開始興建，於1645年完成。
The four pagodas are identical white Buddha-stupas as tall as 26 m (85 ft).	這四座寶塔是相同的白色佛像，高達26米（85英尺）。
Nowadays only the temple for the North Pagoda is well preserved, the East and South has only the pagodas left, and the temple for the West Pagoda was rebuilt in 1998.	如今，只有北塔的寺廟保存完好，東邊和南邊只剩下寶塔，西塔的寺廟於1998年重建。
Both the Temple of Heaven and Temple of Earth were also to be found in the old city during the Qing dynasty.	清朝期間，在舊城區也有天壇和地壇。
They were smaller replicas of Beijing's counterparts.	其為北京天壇地壇的縮小版。
Neither exists today.	今日都不復存。

The central urban area is surrounded by three artificial rivers—respectively the South Canal (南运河) from the south and southeast, the Xinkai River (新开河, formerly the North Canal) from the north and northeast, and the Weigong River (卫工河, formerly the Weigong Nullah) from the west, all interconnected by channels as a continuous waterway.	城市中心被三條人工開挖的河流包圍——分別是南面、東南面的南運河、北面和東北面的新開河（前北運河）和西邊的衛工明渠，彼此相連為一條連續的水道。
The South Canal in particular, famous for the series of linear parks and gardens along it, was constructed upon the old course of the Wanquan River (萬泉河; 'ten thousand springs river'), historically also called the Little Shen River (小瀋水) or Wuli River (五里河; 'five-li river'), which was a principal water source for the old city.  These are reinforced on the peripheries by smaller rivers such as Xi River (细河), Puhe River (蒲河) and Mantang River (满堂河), and drains into the Hun River at three different locations on the southeast, due south and southwest side of the city.	特別是南運河，以其沿線的成排公園和花園而聞名，建在萬泉河的舊河道上，歷史上也被稱為小瀋河或五里河，是舊城區的主要水源。外側有細河、普河和曼塘河（曼塘河）等較小的河流，在該市的東南側和西南側三個不同位置匯入渾河。
There was also previously another canal on the east side called Huishan Nullah (辉山明渠) that drains into Xinkai River's lower section, but is now no longer existent due to land reclamation from urban constructions.	以前，東側還有一條名為輝山明渠的運河，流入新開河下段，但由於城市建設的土地開墾，現在已經不復存在。
Shenyang has many parks, among the most famous are the 14.5 km (9.0 mi) South Canal Linear Parks (南运河带状公园) situated along the homonymous river traversing the southern parts of Dadong, Shenhe and Heping District, covering an area of approximately 1,400,000 m² (350 acres).	瀋陽有許多公園，其中最著名的是14.5公里（9.0英里）的南運河帶狀公園，位於穿越大東區、瀋河區和和平區南側的同名河流沿線，面積約為140萬平方米（350英畝）。

He received a BFA from the Fine Arts Department at Tunghai University, and an MFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York.	他畢業於東海大學美術系，取得美國紐約視覺藝術學院碩士學位。
He is known for using the cultural debris of our modern society, such as old, discarded books, newspapers, phonebooks, and magazines as the medium for his sculptures.	他最聞名的是以各種當代社會的文化垃圾，如被丟棄的舊書、舊報紙、電話簿、雜誌做為雕塑作品媒材。
Chen is self-taught in carving wood, but started showing interest in our paper culture as a viable material for art – phonebooks, magazines, and computer paper when PC’s began growing popular in 1993.	陳的木雕為無師自通，後來開始對利用紙文化做為創作素材感到興趣，包括電話簿、雜誌，1993 年因電腦開始普及，也用印表紙來創作。
The advent of the personal computer changed the entire nature of information documentation – a role books used to play.	個人電腦的發展，整個改變了資訊文件化的本質，原本由書扮演的角色遭到取代。
Thus, by turning paper into the original wood for his sculptures, Chen offers renewed value to the meaning of paper.	因此，陳透過將紙轉變成其木雕作品的材料，賦予紙全新的價值。

For Chen, using recycled materials to make art stresses the challenges presented by endless human consumption and waste, as well as the tantamount ecological problems of waste accumulation and disposal, the destruction of forests, and the mindless use of nonrenewable resources.	對他來說，使用回收材料來製作藝術品，是在強調人類無止境的消費與浪費造成的挑戰，以及廢棄物累積造成的生態問題、森林破壞、以及濫用不可回收資源。
The reams of used computer paper disprove the assurance of the electronic paper-less office, which instead augments the use of paper, as printing is made much easier.	大量使用的電腦紙，否定了電子化無紙辦公室的承諾，因為列印更為方便，用紙量反而增加。
Furthermore, his choice of medium also poses as a commentary on the loss of books as aesthetic objects, which have been replaced by mass-produced cheaply made paperbacks.	另外，他選擇的媒材也反映出書本這種美學載體的失落，因為大量印製的平裝本書籍取而代之。
Books are extremely important to Chen.	對陳龍斌來說，書本非常重要。
However, it is not the book itself, but its educational heritage, literary importance, historical knowledge, and the sacredness of the written word that he treasures most.	但他最重視的並非書本本身，而是其教育傳承、文學重要性、歷史知識以及書寫的神聖性。
The type of materials he acquires in a sense determines the sculpture he creates.	這種有意識的媒材選用，決定其創造出的雕塑作品。

And now, living in Taipei, Chen obtains his material from university libraries and bookstores, publishing companies, archeological museums, and telephone companies.	現在陳住在台北，到大學圖書館、書店、出版社、考古博物館和電話公司收集素材。
The special quality of Chen's works is that people can still read the pages.	陳作品的特色，就是觀眾仍可翻閱書的內容。
“I try to make sculptures that are appropriate for the content of the books.	「我試著讓作品與書的內容相互配合。
In my concept, the form and content is united together; the content gives me the idea of the form.	我認為形式和概念是合一的；內容給我了形式的想法。
Yellow Pages give me one kind of idea; books discarded from libraries inspire different styles…" Often, his art reflects the content of the pages within, such as one hanging installation featuring spirals of books with peepholes in which one can view a scene from the story within the original pages.	黃頁給我一種想法；圖書館丟棄的書啟發另一種風格...」，他的作品經常反應書頁內容，例如有個以螺旋形排列書籍的吊掛作品，附有可以讓觀眾閱讀內頁文字的開孔。

As early as the late Qing dynasty, many vendors were already selling beef slices served cold in the streets of Chengdu, using beef offal because they were relatively inexpensive.	早在晚清時期，許多成都街頭商家，就以較便宜的牛內臟切成薄片來賣。
Because of its low cost, the dish was popular among rickshaw pullers and poor students.	由於售價低廉，這道菜很受人力車腳夫與窮學生歡迎。
In the 1930s, a married couple in Chengdu became famous for making beef slices.	1930 年，一對成都夫妻因為做牛片菜色而知名。
The husband, Guo Zhaohua (郭朝華), and wife, Zhang Tianzheng (張田政), were particular about the beef slices they made, and often experimented with new ingredients.	丈夫郭朝華與妻子張田政以其手製牛肉片聞名，經常實驗各種新成分。
As a result, their beef slices had a distinct taste from the other beef slice vendors, and their business boomed.	因此他們的牛肉片有獨特味道，與眾不同，生意因此興旺。
Often though, mischievous children would pull a prank on the couple, and stick paper notes that read fuqi feipian ("husband and wife lung pieces") on their backs, and sometimes people would yell the words out.	經常有調皮的孩子對他們惡作劇，把寫有「夫妻肺片」的紙片貼在他們背上，有時路人會大聲唸出來。
Later on, a merchant tried the fuqi feipian and was so satisfied, he gave them a gold-lettered plaque that read fuqi feipian, and the name has stuck ever since.	之後有個商人一試之下大為滿意，送了一塊金字匾額給他們，上書夫妻肺片，自此聲名大噪。
To suit their customers' tastes, the couple made many improvements on the dish, and offal slices were eventually replaced by various beef or lamb slices.	為滿足顧客的胃口，兩人針對菜色做了多次改進，內臟薄片最終被各種牛肉與羊肉片取代。
Many people still preferred calling the dish fuqi feipian, thus the name is still used today.	許多人還是喜歡把它稱為夫妻肺片，該名一直沿用至今。
The meaning of fei was originally waste parts or offal (廢) but later changed to lung (肺) so the dish sounded less repulsive.	Fei 本來意指廢，是不要的內臟，後來改成比較不具貶意的「肺」。
The lung could be a part of this offal, but fei is not lung by itself in this dish's meaning.	肺也是內臟的一種，但在這道菜中不是指肺部。

Upon receipt of regulatory approval, EVA Airways Corporation was formally established in March 1989.	在取得監管單位批准後，長榮航空正式於 1989 年 3 月成立。

Unlike some other archaeological sites in the area, the Longquan Temple ruins are relatively well preserved.	和該區域某些考古遺址不同的是，龍泉寺遺址保存相當完整。
Prehistoric artifacts discovered have suggested that the ancient Kaohsiung Harbor was originally a lagoon, with early civilizations functioning primarily as hunter-gatherer societies.	發現的史前文物指出，高雄港在古代可能是個潟湖，原始居民可能主要是採獵社會。

In late 2003, Wei raised NTD 2.5 million and shot a five-minute demonstration film in order to further raise NTD 300 million (USD 10 million) to shoot the complete film.	2003 年末，魏集資新台幣 250 萬元，拍了一部 5 分鐘示範短片，希望能募得 3 億元資金（約 1000 萬美元）以完成該片。
The fundraising failed, and director Chen Kuo-fu advised Wei to make another film to win the trust of investors, so Wei turned his attention to make Cape No. 7.	募資失敗後，導演陳國富建議魏另外拍一部電影以說服投資人，因此魏轉而拍攝《海角 7 號》。
After the success of Cape No.	在《海角
7 in 2008 Wei returned to work on Seediq Bale.	7 號》於 2008 年大獲成功後，魏回頭開始籌拍《賽德克・巴萊》。
However, in 2009 Typhoon Morakot destroyed the set, and the cost grew from NTD 200 million to NTD 600 million.	然而，2009 年的莫拉克風災，摧毀了拍片場景，經費從 2 億元新台幣增加到 6 億元。
Aside from technical problems, Wei said that he had to direct the film and raise the money at the same time, and the company often ran out of money.	除了技術問題外，魏說他得一邊拍片，一邊籌款，公司經常沒有現金。

The film's title was inspired by the 52Hz whale, a creature dubbed the "world’s loneliest whale" because no other whales can hear its 52 Hz frequency calls.	該片片名來自一隻被稱為「世界最寂寞鯨魚的」 52Hz 鯨魚，因為其他鯨魚聽不到牠低達 52Hz 的呼聲。
As Wei said in a teaser, "Just like how no one hears this lonely whale, how many people have love inside of them but nobody knows?	魏在試片時說，「就像沒聽得到的寂寞鯨魚一樣，有多少人心中有愛卻無人得知？
Or simply need a chance to say ‘I love you’ and be heard?"	其實只需要一個說出『我愛你』而被聽到的機會？」

For a time, Gulangyu had the peculiarity of having constituted the only international settlement on Chinese soil apart from the more celebrated International Settlement at Shanghai.	有一段時間，鼓浪嶼的特色是成為中國在上海這個更加知名的公共租界外，中國土地上唯一的公共租界。
Soon after Xiamen became a treaty port resulting from China's loss in the First Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, foreign residents on the island established an informal organization that became formally organized several decades later when its Land Regulations were approved by the government of China in May 1902.	1842 年中國打輸第一次鴉片戰爭，簽下南京條約，使廈門成為通商口岸後，島上的外國居民成立了非正式的組織，而在數十年後的 1902 年 5 月政府核准該島的規範後，成為正式的組織。
Eventually 13 countries, including Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Japan, were to enjoy extraterritorial privileges there and take part in the Kulangsu Municipal Council that administered the settlement.	最終有 13 國，包括英國、法國、荷蘭、日本等，可以享有治外法權，在居地參與鼓浪嶼參議會。
As with the Shanghai International Settlement, the British played a predominant role in the administration and Sikh policemen from British India were charged with the policing of the Settlement under the Kulangsu Municipal Police.	如同上海公共租界，英國在行政方面扮演重要角色，派任英屬印度的錫克警察，受鼓浪嶼警局管轄，維持租界治安。
The consulates, churches, hospitals, schools, police stations, etc. built by those foreign communities explain the predominantly Victorian-era style architecture that can still be seen throughout Gulangyu.	由外國社區建立的領事館、教堂、學校、警察局等，是整個鼓浪嶼仍留存許多維多利亞時代風格建築的主因。
Japanese occupation of the island began in 1942, and lasted until the end of World War II.	日本自 1942 年起佔領該導，直到二戰後結束佔領。
The Hokkien dialect is spoken on the island, as it is in Xiamen.	由於位在廈門，該區的方言是福建話。
After the establishment of the PRC, Gulangyu was a district of Xiamen, one of four in the municipality not located on Xiamen Island until 2003.	在中華人民共和國建國後，鼓浪嶼在 2003 年之前，是廈門市的四個不在廈門島上的區之一。
In May of that year Gulangyu District was absorbed into Siming District, and has since been administered, policed, and adjudicated from Xiamen Island, just across the Lujiang River.	該年 5 月鼓浪嶼併入思明區，由就在鷺江河對面的廈門島管理行政、警務、司法。
Gulangyu is unique in China as a "traffic-free island".	鼓浪嶼是中國的「無車島」，十分特別。
It is connected to the main island of Xiamen only by ferry.	該島只透過渡輪連接廈門主島。
Neither cars nor bicycles are allowed, thus providing an alternative to the frenetic Xiamen Island across the river, although the recent introduction of electric tourist buggies may be damaging the island's charm.	汽車和自行車都禁行，對河對岸的人廈門島形成對比，但最近導入的電動旅遊車，可能降低該島的魅力。
Freight is pulled on wheeled wooden carts up the often steep lanes by strong teams of men.	許多壯漢組隊，把貨物裝在木製輪車上，拉過許多陡峭的小徑。
The spread of Christianity in 1900s brought western music to the island.	1900 年代傳入的基督教，也把西洋音樂帶來此島。
Churches and museums were built, and people enjoyed going to music halls to hear performances.	到處建有教堂與博物館，民眾也喜歡到音樂廳聽音樂會。
Since then, the island's local cultural environment mingled with introduced foreign music and art, which is why the Gulangyu cultural scene differs from other parts of China.	之後該島的文化環境就融入了外來的音樂與藝術，也讓鼓浪嶼的文化風景與中國其他地方不同。
A number of China's most famous classical musicians come from Gulangyu, including the pianist Yin Chengzong, the violist Jing Yang, and the pianist Xu Feiping.	不少中國最知名的古典音樂家就來自鼓浪嶼，包括鋼琴家殷承宗、小提琴家楊璟、鋼琴家許斐平等。
Historically, Shu'an Zhou, Junji Lin, and Zuohuang Chen are other well-known classical musicians from the island.	其他該島出身的知名古典音樂家，還包括周淑安、Junji Lin、陳佐湟等人。
Gulangyu's piano ownership per capita ranks the first in nation, and by 2002, Gulangyu Island was given the name of "The Island of Music" by Chinese Musicians' Association.	鼓浪嶼的家戶鋼琴擁有台數是全中國第一，於 2002 年該島獲得中國音樂家協會頒給「音樂之島」頭銜。
The piano exhibition halls and museums and overall artistic atmosphere attract many musicians domestically and internationally.	鋼琴展示廳、博物館與整體的藝術氣息，吸引國內外許多音樂家。
The 580-seat Gulangyu Concert Hall is one of Fujian Province's most notable acoustic classical music venues.	擁有 580 席的鼓浪嶼是福建省最著名的古典音樂廳之一。

Duck has been roasted in China since the Southern and Northern Dynasties.	自南北朝開始，中國就有了烤鴨。
A variation of roast duck was prepared for the Emperor of China in the Yuan dynasty.	元朝時，有多種不同烤鴨呈獻給皇帝。
The dish, originally named "shāo yāzi" (燒鴨子), was mentioned in the Complete Recipes for Dishes and Beverages (飲膳正要) manual in 1330 by Hu Sihui (忽思慧), an inspector of the imperial kitchen.	這道菜在 1330 年由飲膳太醫勿思慧撰寫的《飲膳正要》一書中名為「燒鴨子」。
The Peking Roast Duck that came to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming dynasty, and by then, Peking Duck was one of the main dishes on imperial court menus.	北平烤鴨之名在晚明一代逐漸發展起來，當時北平烤鴨是宮廷菜單上的一道主菜。
The first restaurant specialising in Peking Duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, close to Qianmen of Beijing in 1416.	第一家專精北平烤鴨的餐廳便宜坊，於 1416 年成立於北京前口附近的鮮魚口。
By the Qianlong Period (1736–1796) of the Qing dynasty, the popularity of Peking Duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring poetry from poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish.	在清朝乾隆年間（1736-1796），北平烤鴨在上層階級開始普及，給了許多嗜食此物的詩人與文士許多靈感。
For instance, one verse of Dūmén zhúzhīcí, a Beijing local poem was, "Fill your plates with roast duck and suckling pig".	例如在《Dumen zhuzhici》中的一首北京當地詩句，就提到「以烤鴨和乳豬盛盤」。
In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing.	1864 年全聚德餐廳於北京成立。
Yang Quanren (楊全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks.	全聚德創始人楊全仁發明了烤鴨用的烘爐。
With its innovations and efficient management, the restaurant became well known in China, introducing the Peking Duck to the rest of the world.	由於其創新與便於管理，該餐廳變得聞名全中國，且讓北平烤鴨之名傳遍世界。
By the mid-20th century, Peking Duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike.	二十世紀中期，北平烤鴨已成為中國的象徵，受觀光客與外交人員喜愛。
For example, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, during his first (secret) visit to China.	例如美國國務卿季辛吉，於 1971 年 7 月 10 日首次訪問中國時，在人民大會堂拜會周恩來。
After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite.	在早上一輪沒有結論的會談後，午餐的菜色是北平烤鴨，後來成為季辛吉的最愛。
The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972.	隔日發表中美聯合聲明，並邀請尼克森總統於 1972 年訪問中國。
Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking Duck.	1976 年周恩來去世後，季辛吉再度訪問北京，享用北平烤鴨的美味。
Peking Duck, at the Quanjude in particular, has also been a favorite dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban Fidel Castro to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.	北平烤鴨，特別是全聚德的，已成為各國政要如卡斯楚、德國總理柯爾等人的最愛餐點。
Two notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become household names, each with their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique of closed oven roasting.	北京最有名的兩家餐廳是全聚德與便宜坊兩家百年老店，不但街坊聞名，且各有特色：全聚德以其烘爐烤法聞名，便宜坊則使用閉爐古法。
Fattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, eviscerated and rinsed thoroughly with water.	育肥的鴨隻，在屠宰後拔毛、取出內臟，並且以水完全洗淨。
Air is pumped under the skin through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat.	接著自頸部開孔，灌入空氣，以將皮肉分開。
The duck is then plunged in boiling water for 1 to 5 minutes, and then hung to dry.	接著將鴨過滾水約1到5分鐘，接著掛起晾乾。
This will tighten the skin and help the duck to achieve its traditional crispy texture.	這會讓鴨皮緊繃，以創造出傳統的鴨皮酥脆口感。
The duck is then glazed with a layer of potentially spiced and flavored maltose syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water.	之後在鴨身抹上一層加有香辛料的麥芽糖漿，內部再以清水洗淨一次。
A marinade of traditional flavorings, including soy sauce and five-spice powder, and more maltose, is then applied inside the body cavity.	接著自鴨身開口處灌入含有醬油、五香粉、大量麥芽糖的傳統滷汁。
This will flavor the duck during the next step.	這樣在接下來的步驟中，即可讓鴨肉入味。
The duck is then left to dry for between 24 hours and several days in a cool, dry place (or a refrigerator).	之後將鴨子置於乾冷處（或是冰箱內）存放 24 小時至數天，以便乾燥。
The drying allows the skin to crisp while roasting.	乾燥過程可讓鴨皮在烘烤時變得酥脆。
It is then roasted in an oven until the skin turns shiny brown.	接著放入爐中烘烤，烤到鴨皮變得油亮棕色為止。
While roasting, hot water is added to the body cavity as needed to ensure even cooking and tenderness.	烘烤時，必須將熱水注入鴨身中，以確保均勻烘烤，肉質柔軟。
Some preparations involve the duck being smoked with fruity woods.	需要準備一些果樹木頭來燻烤鴨身。
Besides traditional methods to prepare Peking Duck, recipes have been compiled by chefs around the world to produce the dish at home.	除了傳統北平烤鴨製法外，各國廚師也發明多種在家調理的食譜。
Peking duck is originally roasted in a closed oven (Chinese: 焖炉), and Bianyifang is the restaurant that keeps this tradition.	北平烤鴨傳統上使用燜爐來烤，便宜坊就是採取這種古法。
The closed oven is built of brick and fitted with metal griddles (Chinese: 箅子; pinyin: bì zi).	燜爐以磚塊砌成，內有金屬箅子。
The oven is preheated by burning Gaoliang sorghum straw (Chinese: 秫秸; pinyin: shú jiē) at the base.	這種烤爐要在底部燃燒秫秸進行預熱。
The duck is placed in the oven immediately after the fire burns out, allowing the meat to be slowly cooked through the convection of heat within the oven.	當火熄滅後，要立即將鴨子放入烤爐內，讓爐子內的餘熱緩緩將鴨子烤熟。
Controlling the fuel and the temperature is the main skill.	主要的技巧是控制燃料與溫度。
In closed-oven style, duck meat is combined well with the fat under the skin, and therefore is juicy and tender.	以燜爐方式製作，鴨肉會與皮下脂肪結合，使得口感綿密而多汁。
The open oven (Chinese: 挂炉; literally: 'hung oven') was developed in the imperial kitchens during the Qing Dynasty, and adopted by the Quanjude restaurant chain.	掛爐是在清宮御膳房中發展出來的，全聚德連鎖餐廳加以發揚光大。
It is designed to roast up to 20 ducks at the same time with an open fire fueled by hardwood from peach or pear trees.	其設計可以透過燃燒桃樹或梨樹枝，一次烤 20 隻鴨。
The ducks are hung on hooks above the fire and roasted at a temperature of 270 °C (525 °F) for 30–40 minutes.	鴨子掛在爐火上的勾子，以攝氏 270 度（華氏 525 度）烤 30-40 分鐘。
While the ducks are roasting, the chef may use a pole to dangle each duck closer to the fire for 30-second intervals.	在烤鴨時，主廚會用一根桿子去晃每隻鴨子，讓鴨子接近爐火約 30 秒。
In open-oven style, the fat is usually melted during the cooking process, so the skin is crispy, and can be eaten separately as a snack.	掛爐烤法中，脂肪會在過程中融化，皮會變得酥脆，可以另作為一道小點。
Almost every part of a duck can be prepared afterwards.	之後鴨子全身上下皆可食用。
Quanjude Restaurant served their customers the "All Duck Banquet" in which they cooked the bones of ducks with vegetables.	全聚德提供給顧客的「全鴨席」，包括佐以蔬菜的烤鴨骨。
The cooked Peking Duck is traditionally carved in front of the diners and served in three stages.	傳統上，烤好的鴨子會在客人面前片鴨，且分三次上菜。
First, the duck skin is served with sugar and garlic sauce as dip.	首先，鴨皮會和糖與蒜醬當做前菜。
The skin tastes better while remaining warm, but it will cool down fast.	鴨皮尚存餘溫時最為美味，不過很快就會冷掉。
The meat is then served with steamed pancakes (simplified Chinese: 春饼; traditional Chinese: 春餅; pinyin: chūn bǐng), spring onions and sweet bean sauce.	鴨肉會與蒸春餅、蔥與甜麵醬一同上菜。
Several vegetable dishes are provided to accompany the meat, typically cucumber sticks.	會有多種蔬菜與肉一同食用，通常是小黃瓜。
Some restaurants offer watermelon radish sticks as alternative.	其他餐廳會以紅心蘿蔔替代。
The diners spread sauce over the pancake.	食客要把醬汁淋上麵餅。
Traditionally, the pancake is wrapped around the meat and spring onion, then eaten by hand.	傳統上要以麵餅裹著鴨肉與蔥，以手持食用。
Cucumber sticks are eaten as refreshment between Peking Duck rolls, but can also be rolled in the pancake.	吃完鴨肉捲後，可以吃小黃瓜以去油，也可以捲進麵餅裡。
The remaining duck (鸭架) can be cooked in three ways.	剩下的鴨架有三種料理方式。
The traditional way is to be cooked into a broth.	傳統料理法是煮湯。
The meat together with bones can also be stir-fried with sweet bean sauce, or rapidly sautéed and served with salt and Sichuan pepper (椒鹽).	肉與骨會以甜麵醬拌炒，或是以四川椒鹽快炒。
Otherwise, they are packed up to be taken home by the customers.	此外，還可以讓顧客打包帶回家。
Whole Peking Ducks can be ordered as takeaways.	北平烤全鴨也可以外帶。
The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil.	帶回家的鴨子可以用烤爐回烤、火烤，或以熱油回溫。
When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a temperature of 150 °C (300 °F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160 °C (325 °F) for another 10 minutes.	使用烤箱的話，以攝氏 150 度（華氏 300 度）回烤 20 分鐘，再以攝氏 160 度（華氏 325 度）再烤 10 分鐘。
The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70 cm (28 in) above the cooking fire.	火烤法要先將鴨肉注以滾水，然後上烤架，離火約 70 公分（28 英吋）。
The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot.	滾水每 3-4 分鐘要更換一次，直到鴨皮滾燙為止。
To reheat the Peking Duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces and placed in a strainer held over a wok of boiling oil.	以油加熱北平烤鴨，鴨要先切成薄片，放在濾網上，很快過一鍋滾油。
The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.	鴨肉要在熱油中浸泡數次。
A number of restaurants in Beijing specialise in Peking Duck.	在北京有不少餐廳精於烤鴨。
Examples include Quanjude, Bianyifang, Changan Yihao (長安一號), Dayali, Beijing Xiaowangfu (北京小王府) and Dadong Kaoyadian (大董烤鴨店).	除了全聚德、便宜坊外，長安一號、大鴨梨、北京小王府、大董烤鴨店都相當知名。
Some restaurants, in particular Quanjude and Bianyifang, have long histories of serving high quality duck that they are now household names, or Lao zihao (老字號), literally "old brand name".	某些餐廳，尤其是全聚德和便宜坊，長期以來供應高級烤鴨，現在成為了「老字號」。
In addition, Quanjude has received worldwide recognition, having been named a China Renowned Trademark in 1999.	此外，全聚德在海外也相當知名，在 1999 年獲得中國馳名商標頭銜。

The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next.	該大壩計畫原本打算採用一種獨特方法來移動船隻；船先開入低水位區與高水位區的水閘，然後以吊車與纜索將船移動到下一個水匣。
In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency.	如果是較小的船隻，可以編組同時移動，以提高效率。
It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods.	目前不知道考慮這種解決方案的原因，是為了要省水，還是因為工程師認為大壩高低差太大，其他方式不可行。
Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, in the midst of the Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.	當時已經完成探勘、調查、經費研究與設計工作，但因中國內戰打到一半，1947 年時政府停止該計畫。
After the 1949 Communist takeover, Mao Zedong supported the project, but began the Gezhouba Dam project nearby first, and economic problems including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution slowed progress.	1949 年共產黨奪權後，毛澤東雖然支持該計畫，但先進行附近的葛州壩計畫，而且因大躍進與文革造成的經濟問題，也拖延了計畫。
After the 1954 Yangtze River Floods, in 1956, Mao Zedong authored "Swimming", a poem about his fascination with a dam on the Yangtze River.	1954 年長江洪災後，1956 年時毛澤東寫了《游泳》一詩，指出他對在長江築壩的執著。
In 1958, after the Hundred Flowers Campaign, some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned.	1958 年百花齊放運動後，一些公開主張反對該計畫的人被捕入獄。
During the 1980s, the idea of a dam reemerged.	1980 年代，大壩計畫再度開始討論。
The National People's Congress approved the dam in 1992: out of 2,633 delegates, 1,767 voted in favour, 177 voted against, 664 abstained, and 25 members did not vote.	1992年人民大會通過大壩興建案，2,633 名代表中，1,767 名投贊成票，664 名反對，25 人未投票。
Construction started on December 14, 1994. The dam was expected to be fully operational in 2009, but additional projects, such as the underground power plant with six additional generators, delayed full operation until May 2012.	建築工程自 1994 年 12 月 14 日開始。預計壩體於 2009 年可完全運作，但由於新增的計畫，例如地下水力發電廠新增六具發電機組，使完全運轉拖到 2012 年 5 月。
The ship lift was completed in 2015.	船塢於 2015 年完工。
The dam had raised the water level in the reservoir to 172.5 m (566 ft) above sea level by the end of 2008 and the designed maximum level of 175 m (574 ft) by October 2010.	大壩讓水庫水位於 2008 年底升至海拔 172.5 公尺（566 英呎），設計最高水位將於 2010 年 10 月到達 175 公尺（574 英呎）。
Made of concrete and steel, the dam is 2,335 m (7,661 ft) long and the top of the dam is 185 m (607 ft) above sea level.	壩體以鋼筋水泥建成，長 2,335 公尺（ 7,661 英呎），最高處達海拔 185 公尺（607 英呎）。
The project used 27.2×10⁶ m³ (35.6×10⁶ cu yd) of concrete (mainly for the dam wall), used 463,000 T of steel (enough to build 63 Eiffel Towers), and moved about 102.6×10⁶ m³ (134.2×10⁶ cu yd) of earth.	該計畫使用了 27.2×10⁶ 立方公尺 (35.6×10⁶ 立方碼) 的水泥（主要用於壩體），並使用 463,000 噸鋼材 （足以建造 63 座巴黎鐵塔），並且搬運了 102.6×10⁶ 立方公尺 (134.2×10⁶ 立方碼）的土方。
The concrete dam wall is 181 m (594 ft) high above the rock basis.	水泥壩體在岩盤上方 181 公尺（594 英呎）。
When the water level is at its maximum of 175 m (574 ft) above sea level, 110 m (361 ft) higher than the river level downstream, the dam reservoir is on average about 660 km (410 mi) in length and 1.12 km (3,675 ft) in width.	達到最高水位海拔 175 公尺（574 英呎）時，會比河川下游高 110 公尺（361 英呎），水庫平均長 660 公里（410 英哩）、寬 1.12 公里（3,675 英呎）。
It contains 39.3 km³ (31,900,000 acre⋅ft) of water and has a total surface area of 1,045 km² (403 sq mi).	內含 39.3 立方公里（31,900,000 立方英呎）的水，總面積達 1,045 平方公里（403 平方英哩）。
On completion, the reservoir flooded a total area of 632 km² (244 sq mi) of land, compared to the 1,350 km² (520 sq mi) of reservoir created by the Itaipu Dam.	完工後，水庫淹沒土地廣達 632 平方公里（244 平方英哩），而伊泰普水壩的庫區則為 1,350 平方公里（520 平方英哩）。
The government estimated that the Three Gorges Dam project would cost 180 billion yuan (US$22.5 billion).	政府估計三峽大壩工程將耗資 1,800 億元人民幣（225 億美元）。
By the end of 2008, spending had reached 148.365 billion yuan, among which 64.613 billion yuan was spent on construction, 68.557 billion yuan on relocating affected residents, and 15.195 billion yuan on financing.	2008 年底，耗資將達 1,483.65 億元人民幣，其中 646.13 億元用於工程建設、685.57 億元用於受影響居民搬遷、151.95 億元用於財務。
It was estimated in 2009 that the construction cost would be recovered when the dam had generated 1,000 terawatt-hours (3,600 PJ) of electricity, yielding 250 billion yuan.	2009 年時估計建設經費將在大壩發電達 1,000 太瓦時（3,600 皮焦耳）時損益兩平，收入將達 2,500 億元人民幣。
Full cost recovery was thus expected to occur ten years after the dam started full operation, but the full cost of the Three Gorges Dam was recovered by December 20, 2013.	預計將在大壩完全運轉十年後完成弭平支出，實際上的支出完全弭平是在 2013 年 12 月 20 日。
Funding sources include the Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund, profits from the Gezhouba Dam, loans from the China Development Bank, loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks, corporate bonds, and revenue from both before and after the dam is fully operational.	資金來源包括三峽大壩建設基金、葛州壩收益、自國家開發銀行的貸款、國內外商業銀行貸款、公司債，以及大壩完全運轉前後的收入。
Additional charges were assessed as follows: Every province receiving power from the Three Gorges Dam had to pay ¥7.00 per MWh extra.	另外也徵收下列費用：每個使用三峽大壩電力的省份，每百萬度電要支付人民幣 7 元。
Other provinces had to pay an additional charge of ¥4.00 per MWh.	其他省份必須支付每百萬度電 4 元。
The Tibet Autonomous Region pays no surcharge.	西藏自治區不用付費。

However, electricity demand has increased more quickly than previously projected.	然而，用電需求成長遠高於預期。
Even fully operational, on average, it supports only about 1.7% of electricity demand in China in the year of 2011, when the Chinese electricity demand reached 4692.8 TWh.	即使全力運轉，中國用電量於 2011 年將達 4692.8 TWh，該電廠只能提供 1.7%。
According to the National Development and Reform Commission of China, 366 grams of coal would produce 1 kWh of electricity during 2006.	根據國家發改委估計，2006 年時 366 克煤可產生 1kWh 電力。
At full power, Three Gorges reduces coal consumption by 31 million tonnes per year, avoiding 100 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, millions of tonnes of dust, one million tonnes of sulfur dioxide, 370,000 tonnes of nitric oxide, 10,000 tonnes of carbon monoxide, and a significant amount of mercury.	滿載運轉時，三峽大壩可以減少煤炭用量達每年 3,100 萬噸，避免排放 1 億噸溫室氣體，數百萬噸塵埃、100 萬噸二氧化硫、37 萬噸氮氧化物、1 萬噸一氧化碳、以及為數可觀的汞。
Hydropower saves the energy needed to mine, wash, and transport the coal from northern China.	水力發電取代自中國北方挖掘、洗選、運送煤炭所需的能源。
From 2003 to 2007, power production equaled that of 84 million tonnes of standard coal, reducing carbon dioxide by 190 million tonnes, sulfur dioxide by 2.29 million tonnes, and nitrogen oxides by 980,000 tonnes.	2003 至 2007 年，其發電相當於 8,400 萬噸標準煤，減少 1,900 萬噸二氧化碳、 22.9 萬噸二氧化硫、98 萬噸氮氧化物。

From 2004 to 2007, a total of 198 million tonnes of goods passed through the ship locks.	2004 - 2007 年，共有 1.98 億噸貨物自水閘進出。
Compared to using trucking, barges reduced carbon dioxide emission by ten million tonnes and lowered costs by 25%.	相較於卡車運輸，水運降低碳排達 1,000 萬噸，成本降低 25%。
Erosion in the reservoir, induced by rising water, causes frequent major landslides that have led to noticeable disturbance in the reservoir surface, including two incidents in May 2009 when somewhere between 20,000 and 50,000 cubic metres (26,000 and 65,000 cu yd) of material plunged into the flooded Wuxia Gorge of the Wu River.	水位上升造成的水庫侵蝕，經常產生大型崩塌，使得水庫表面發生可注意到的擾流，包括 2009 年 5 月的兩起事故，當時在某處有 2 萬到5 萬立方公尺（26,000 及 65,000 立方碼）的物體掉落至巫峽所在的烏江。
Also, in the first four months of 2010, there were 97 significant landslides.	而在 2010 年頭四個月，就發生 97 起大型山崩。
The dam catalyzed improved upstream wastewater treatment around Chongqing and its suburban areas.	大壩也激發重慶及其郊區上游廢水處理的改善。
According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007, more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84 million tonnes per day, 65% of the total need.	根據環保部門統計，截至 2007 年 4 月，新增 50 處以上廢水處理廠，每日可處理 184 萬噸廢水，達需求的 65%。
About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5 tonnes of solid waste every day.	新增 32 處掩埋廠，每日可以處理 7,664.5 噸固體廢棄物。
Over one billion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which was more likely to be swept away before the reservoir was created.	每年有超過 10 億噸廢水注入河中，在水庫建成前必須掃除。
This has left the water looking stagnant, polluted and murky.	這會造成水流停滯、污染並且發黑。
In 1997, the Three Gorges area had 10% forestation, down from 20% in the 1950s.	1950 年代三峽壩區原有 20% 造林地，1997 年降為 10%。
Research by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization suggested that the Asia-Pacific region would, overall, gain about 6,000 km² (2,300 sq mi) of forest by 2008.	聯合國糧農組織的研究指出，亞太地區在 2008 年前的森林面積應增加 6,000 平方公里（2,300 平方英哩）。
That is a significant change from the 13,000 km² (5,000 sq mi) net loss of forest each year in the 1990s.	1990 年代，每年損失 13,000 平方公里（5,000 平方英哩）森林，這是很大的改變。
This is largely due to China's large reforestation effort.	主要來自中國大規模造林的努力。
This accelerated after the 1998 Yangtze River floods convinced the government that it must restore tree cover, especially in the Yangtze's basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.	在 1998 年長江洪災後，政府相信必須提高森林覆蓋，特別是長江上游三峽大壩區。
In 2010, NASA scientists calculated that shift of water mass stored by the dams would increase the length of the Earth's day by 0.06 microseconds and make the Earth slightly more round in the middle and flat on the poles.	2010 年，NASA 科學家計算大壩儲存的水質量，會讓地球每天變長 0.06 微秒，讓地球中間變圓一點，兩極變扁一點。
An important function of the dam is to control flooding, which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze.	大壩一個重要功能是控制洪水，對長江是個季節性的問題。
Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai situated adjacent to the river.	數百萬人居住在大壩下游，也有許多如武漢、南京、上海等臨河大城市。
Plenty of farm land and China's most important industrial area are built beside the river.	大片農地和中國最重要的工業區都建於河邊。
The reservoir's flood storage capacity is 22 cubic kilometres (5.3 cu mi; 18,000,000 acre⋅ft).	水庫淹沒區的容量為 22 立方公里（5.3 立方英哩、18,000,000 立方英呎）
This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every 10 years to once every 100 years.	庫容可以降低下游大型洪災的發生頻率，自原本十年一次降為百年一次。
The dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a "super" flood.	該壩也預期可以降低超大洪水的災害。

According to oral history, the plant and the jelly were named after the daughter of a Taiwanese tea businessman in the 1800s.	根據口述歷史，這種植物和果凍是以19世紀一位臺灣茶葉商人的女兒命名的。
The jelling property of the seeds was discovered by the businessman as he drank from a creek in Chiayi.	該商人在嘉義的一條小溪上喝水時，發現了這種種子可以結成果凍的特性。
He found a clear yellowish jelly in the water he was drinking and was refreshed upon trying it.	他在喝的水中發現了一種清澈的淡黃色果凍，嘗試後發現味道清新。
Looking above the creek he noticed fruits on hanging vines.	在小溪上方，他看到懸掛的藤蔓上有一種果實。
The fruits contained seeds that exuded a sticky gel when rubbed.	果實中含有種子，揉搓時會產生黏稠的凝膠。
Upon this discovery, he gathered some of the fruits and served them at home with honeyed lemon juice or sweetened beverages.	發現這點後，他收集了一些果實，並在家中用蜂蜜檸檬汁或甜味飲料一起食用。

The dry fruits can be sold as is, or dried aiyu seeds (Chinese: 愛玉子; pinyin: aiyu zi) can then be pulled off the skin and sold separately.	乾果可以按原樣出售，或者將乾愛玉子自果皮上取下另售。
The gelling agent in aiyu seeds is pectin.	愛玉子中的凝膠劑是果膠。
Pectines are located in the transparent layer on the surface of seeds and not the inside of seeds, which is why they are extracted by washing and rubbing instead of grounding to a powder.	果膠位於種子表面的透明層中，而不是種子內部，這就是為何要透過洗滌和摩擦取得，而非磨成粉末後再取出。
The main component of the water extract was found to be LMP (low methoxy pectin), as opposed to high metoxy pectins prevalent in commercially used sources such as apples or citrus peels.	水萃取物的主要成分是 LMP（低甲氧基果膠），而不是蘋果或柑橘皮等商用來源中普遍存在的高甲氧基果膠。
LMP gels in presence of divalent cations, which are found in sufficient amount in water (when it's not distilled), thus causing a creation of jelly.	LMP凝膠存在二價陽離子，這些陽離子在水中（未蒸餾時）有足夠的數量，因而生成果凍。

How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the Tang dynasty, the area of modern-day Shanghai was under the sea level, so the land appeared to be literally "on the sea".	該名稱應如何解釋容有爭議，但中國歷史學者的結論是，在唐代時今上海所在地仍在海平面下，因此該地的出現確實「是在海上」。
Shanghai is officially abbreviated 沪 (Hù/Vu²) in Chinese, a contraction of 沪渎 (Hù Dú/Vu Doh, lit "Harpoon Ditch"), a 4th- or 5th-century Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean.	上海的中文官方簡稱為「滬」，是滬瀆的簡寫，約 4-5 時紀時晉朝女一將蘇州河口以此為名，當時是注入海中的主要河道。

During the Tang and Song dynasties, Qinglong Town (青龍鎮) in modern Qingpu District was a major trading port.	在唐宋時期，青浦區的青龍鎮是主要貿易港口。

Two important events helped promote Shanghai's development in the Ming dynasty.	於明朝發生的兩起重要事件，對促進上海的發展有功。
A city wall was built for the first time in 1554 to protect the town from raids by Japanese pirates.	1554年首次修建城牆，以保護該鎮免於倭寇襲擊。

A City God Temple was built in 1602 during the Wanli reign.	1602年萬曆年間，市區內興建一座神廟。
This honor was usually reserved for prefectural capitals and not normally given to a mere county seat such as Shanghai.	通常只有縣的首府可以建廟，通常不會讓上海這樣的小城建廟。
Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.	學者認為，這可能反映了該鎮的經濟重要性，而非其較低的政治地位。
During the Qing dynasty, Shanghai became one of the most important sea ports in the Yangtze Delta region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the Kangxi Emperor reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels—a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the Qianlong Emperor moved the customs office for Jiangsu province (江海关; see Customs House, Shanghai) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade.	清朝期間，由於兩個重要的中央政府政策變化，上海成為長江三角洲地區最重要的海港之一：1684年，康熙皇帝廢除明朝對遠洋船隻的禁令，這項禁令自1525年以來一直有效；1732年，乾隆皇帝將江蘇省海關辦公室（江海關；見上海海關總署）從松江縣首府遷至上海，並賦予上海對江蘇對外貿易海關收繳關稅的專屬控制權。
As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.	由於這兩項關鍵決定，上海到1735年成為整個長江下游地區的主要貿易港口，雖然在政治制度中仍處於最低的行政等級。
In the 19th century, international attention to Shanghai grew due to European recognition of its economic and trade potential at the Yangtze.	在19世紀，由於歐洲發現上海在長江的經濟和貿易潛力，國際社會對上海的注意力愈來愈大。
During the First Opium War (1839–1842), British forces occupied the city.	在第一次鴉片戰爭（1839-1842年）期間，英軍佔領了這座城市。
The war ended in 1842 with the Treaty of Nanking, which opened Shanghai as one of the five treaty ports for international trade.	戰爭於1842年結束，隨後簽署《南京條約》，該條約將上海開放為國際貿易的五個通商口岸之一。
The Treaty of the Bogue, the Treaty of Wanghia, and the Treaty of Whampoa (signed in 1843, 1844, and 1844, respectively) forced Chinese concession to European and American desires for visitation and trade on Chinese soil.	《虎門條約》、《望廈條約》和《黃浦條約》（分別於1843年、1844年和1844年簽署）迫使中國屈服於歐洲和美國進出中國領土並進行貿易的欲望。
Britain, France, and the United States all carved out outside the walled city of Shanghai, which was still ruled by the Chinese.	英國、法國和美國都在上海城外大舉運作，唯有內城仍然由中國人治理。
