Although software testing can determine the correctness of software under the assumption of some specific hypotheses (see the hierarchy of testing difficulty below), testing cannot identify all the defects within the software.	虽然软件测试可以在一些特定的假设条件（见下文的测试难度等级）的假设下鉴定软件的准确性，但通过测试并不能找到软件内部的所有缺陷。
Instead, it furnishes a criticism or comparison that compares the state and behavior of the product against test oracles—principles or mechanisms by which someone might recognize a problem.	它只是提供了一种批评意见，或者说进行了一次比较，将该产品的状态和行为与测试准则（即一组原则或机制，通过这些原则或机制可能会认识到问题所在）进行对比。
These oracles may include (but are not limited to) specifications, contracts, comparable products, past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose, user or customer expectations, relevant standards, applicable laws, or other criteria.	这些准则可能包括（但不限于）规范、合同、可比产品，该产品的以往版本，以及对预期目的或预期使用目的、用户或客户期望、相关标准、适用法律或其它标准的推断。
A primary purpose of testing is to detect software failures so that defects may be discovered and corrected.	测试的主要目的是检测软件故障，发现缺陷并改正缺陷。
Testing cannot establish that a product functions properly under all conditions, but only that it does not function properly under specific conditions.	测试只能检测出该产品在某种特定的情形下无法正常运行，而不能证实该产品在所有情况下都能正常运行。
The scope of software testing often includes the examination of code as well as the execution of that code in various environments and conditions as well as examining the aspects of code: does it do what it is supposed to do and do what it needs to do.	软件测试的测试范围通常包括检查代码、在各种环境和条件下执行该代码以及检查代码的一些方面：代码的行为是否达到预期？代码的行为是否符合需求？
In the current culture of software development, a testing organization may be separate from the development team.	在当前的软件开发文化下，测试团队和开发团队有可能是分开的。
There are various roles for testing team members.	测试团队的成员有多种角色。
Information derived from software testing may be used to correct the process by which software is developed.	从软件测试中获得的信息可以用于纠正开发该软件的过程。
Every software product has a target audience.	每一款软件都有其对应的目标受众。
For example, the audience for video game software is completely different from banking software.	比方说，电子游戏软件的受众就和银行软件的受众完全不同。
Therefore, when an organization develops or otherwise invests in a software product, it can assess whether the software product will be acceptable to its end users, its target audience, its purchasers and other stakeholders.	因此，某个机构在开发或投资一款软件产品时，可以评估该软件产品到底能不能为终端用户、目标受众、消费者以及其他利益相关者所接受。
Software testing aids the process of attempting to make this assessment.	在尝试进行这种评估的过程中，我们可以借助于软件测试。
Not all software defects are caused by coding errors.	并非所有的软件缺陷都是由代码错误导致的。
One common source of expensive defects is requirement gaps, i.e., unrecognized requirements that result in errors of omission by the program designer.	代价高昂的缺陷通常来源于需求缺口，即需求未被识别，导致程序设计人员遗漏而出错。
Requirement gaps can often be non-functional requirements such as testability, scalability, maintainability, performance, and security.	需求缺口通常是一些非功能性需求，如稳定性、可扩展性、可维护性、性能、安全性等。
Software faults occur through the following processes.	通过以下过程会发生软件故障：
A programmer makes an error (mistake), which results in a defect (fault, bug) in the software source code.	程序员犯了一个错误（过失），导致软件的源代码出现了一个缺陷（故障，漏洞）。
If this defect is executed, in certain situations the system will produce wrong results, causing a failure.	如果执行这一缺陷，系统在某些情况下会产生错误结果，从而导致软件失效。
Not all defects will necessarily result in failures.	并非所有的缺陷都会导致失效。
For example, defects in the dead code will never result in failures.	比如，无用代码中的缺陷就不会导致失效。
A defect can turn into a failure when the environment is changed.	当所在环境发生变化时，一个缺陷可能就会变成一次失效。
Examples of these changes in environment include the software being run on a new computer hardware platform, alterations in source data, or interacting with different software.	环境发生变化的例子包括软件在新的计算机硬件平台上运行、源数据发生改变、与不同的软件进行交互等等。
A single defect may result in a wide range of failure symptoms.	单个缺陷可能会导致各种各样的失效症状。
A fundamental problem with software testing is that testing under all combinations of inputs and preconditions (initial state) is not feasible, even with a simple product.	软件测试的一个基本问题是，即便是简单的软件产品，也不可能做到将各种输入和前提条件（初始状态）的所有组合都测试一遍。
This means that the number of defects in a software product can be very large and defects that occur infrequently are difficult to find in testing.	这意味着一款软件产品的缺陷数量可能非常庞大，而且不经常发生的缺陷在测试中很难发现。
More significantly, non-functional dimensions of quality (how it is supposed to be versus what it is supposed to do)—usability, scalability, performance, compatibility, reliability—can be highly subjective; something that constitutes sufficient value to one person may be intolerable to another.	更重要的是，软件质量（应该是什么样子 vs 应该具备什么功能）的一些非功能性维度——可用性、可扩展性、性能、兼容性、可靠性——可能带有很强的主观性，一个东西可能这个人觉得很有价值，另一个人却觉得不能忍受。
Software developers can't test everything, but they can use combinatorial test design to identify the minimum number of tests needed to get the coverage they want.	软件开发人员无法测试所有内容，但通过组合测试设计，他们可以确定获得自己想要的覆盖率所需的最少测试数是多少。
Combinatorial test design enables users to get greater test coverage with fewer tests.	组合测试设计使用户能够以更少的测试获得更大的测试覆盖率。
Whether they are looking for speed or test depth, they can use combinatorial test design methods to build structured variation into their test cases.	不管他们追求的是速度还是测试深度，他们都可以利用组合测试设计的各种方法，将结构化变差构建到他们的测试用例中。
A study conducted by NIST in 2002 reports that software bugs cost the U.S. economy $59.5 billion annually.	美国国家标准与技术研究院 2002 年的一份研究报告表示，软件漏洞每年给美国带来的经济损失达 595 亿美元。
More than a third of this cost could be avoided, if better software testing was performed.	只要在软件测试方面多下一点功夫，三分之一以上的损失都是可以避免的。
Outsourcing software testing because of costs is very common, with China, the Philippines and India being preferred destinations.	由于成本原因，软件测试普遍外包，其中中国、菲律宾、印度是外包的首选之地。
Software testing can be done by dedicated software testers.	软件测试可以交给专门的软件测试员来做。
Until the 1980s, the term "software tester" was used generally, but later it was also seen as a separate profession.	直到 20 世纪 80 年代，“软件测试员”都还是一种范称，但后来，这个词也被看作是一种专门的职业。
Regarding the periods and the different goals in software testing, different roles have been established, such as test manager, test lead, test analyst, test designer, tester, automation developer, and test administrator.	软件测试的各个阶段和不同目标分别对应着各种不同的角色，如测试经理、测试主管、测试分析师、测试设计师、测试人员、自动化开发人员和测试管理员。
Software testing can also be performed by non-dedicated software testers.	软件测试也可以由非专业的软件测试人员执行。
Glenford J. Myers initially introduced the separation of debugging from testing in 1979.	1979 年，格伦福德·J·迈尔斯最先提出要将调试和测试分离开来。
Although his attention was on breakage testing ("A successful test case is one that detects an as-yet undiscovered error.") it illustrated the desire of the software engineering community to separate fundamental development activities, such as debugging, from that of verification.	虽然他当时的初衷是破损测试（“一个成功的测试用例是能够检测到尚未发现的错误的用例”），但此举体现出了在软件工程界，人们想要将诸如调试之类的基本开发操作与软件的验证操作分离开来的愿望。
There are many approaches available in software testing.	可用于软件测试的方法有很多。
Reviews, walkthroughs, or inspections are referred to as static testing, whereas executing programmed code with a given set of test cases is referred to as dynamic testing.	审查、走查或检验的过程被称为静态测试，而用一组给定的测试用例来执行编程代码的过程被称为动态测试。
Dynamic testing takes place when the program itself is run.	动态测试则发生在程序本身也在运行的时候。
Dynamic testing may begin before the program is 100% complete in order to test particular sections of code and are applied to discrete functions or modules.	动态测试可以在程序尚未 100% 完成之前就开始，以测试特定的代码段并应用于离散的函数或模块中。
Typical techniques for these are either using stubs/drivers or execution from a debugger environment.	对此的通常做法要么是利用 stub 或 driver，要么是在调试器的环境中执行。
Static testing involves verification, whereas dynamic testing also involves validation.	静态测试中涉及到验证，而动态测试中也涉及到验证。
Passive testing means verifying the system behavior without any interaction with the software product.	被动测试的意思是在不与该软件产品进行互动的情况下验证系统的行为。
Contrary to active testing, testers do not provide any test data but look at system logs and traces.	与主动测试相反，测试人员并不提供任何测试数据，而是观察系统留下的日志和痕迹。
They mine for patterns and specific behavior in order to make some kind of decisions.	他们挖掘模式和特定行为，以便作出某种决定。
This is related to offline runtime verification and log analysis.	其中关系到脱机运行时的验证和日志分析。
Exploratory testing is an approach to software testing that is concisely described as simultaneous learning, test design and test execution.	探索性测试是一种软件测试方法，简单而言就是同时进行学习、测试设计和测试执行。
Cem Kaner, who coined the term in 1984, defines exploratory testing as "a style of software testing that emphasizes the personal freedom and responsibility of the individual tester to continually optimize the quality of his/her work by treating test-related learning, test design, test execution, and test result interpretation as mutually supportive activities that run in parallel throughout the project."	“探索性测试”这个词是由杰姆·卡尼尔于 1984 年所创，他将其定义为“一种强调测试员个人自由和责任的软件测试风格，测试员可以将与软件测试相关的学习、测试设计、测试执行、测试结果解释看作整个程序中并行运行、相互支持的活动，以持续优化其作品的质量”。
Software testing methods are traditionally divided into white- and black-box testing.	 软件测试历来有两种方法：白盒测试和黑盒测试。
These two approaches are used to describe the point of view that the tester takes when designing test cases.	这两种方法用来描述测试员在设计测试用例时所采取的视角。
A hybrid approach called grey-box testing may also be applied to software testing methodology.	将这两者结合起来的测试法叫灰盒测试，这种方法也被用在软件测试方法论中。
With the concept of grey-box testing—which develops tests from specific design elements—gaining prominence, this "arbitrary distinction" between black- and white-box testing has faded somewhat.	随着灰盒测试（从某些特定的设计元素上进行测试开发）的概念变得越来越重要，黑盒测试和百合测试之间的这种“任意差异”已经有所减弱。
Black-box testing (also known as functional testing) treats the software as a "black box," examining functionality without any knowledge of internal implementation, without seeing the source code.	黑盒测试（也叫“功能测试”）将程序视作一个“黑盒”，在不知道内部执行情况也不查看源代码的情况下检查程序的功能。
The testers are only aware of what the software is supposed to do, not how it does it.	测试员只关注该软件是何用途，无需关注其实现方式。
Black-box testing methods include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all-pairs testing, state transition tables, decision table testing, fuzz testing, model-based testing, use case testing, exploratory testing, and specification-based testing.	黑盒测试的方法有：等价类划分、边界值分析、全对测试、状态转换表法、判定表测试、模糊测试、基于模型的测试、用例测试、探索性测试以及基于规格说明的测试。
Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality of software according to the applicable requirements.	基于规格说明的测试旨在根据适用要求对软件的功能进行测试。
This level of testing usually requires thorough test cases to be provided to the tester, who then can simply verify that for a given input, the output value (or behavior), either "is" or "is not" the same as the expected value specified in the test case.	这一级别的测试通常需要向测试员提供详尽的测试用例，然后测试员可以通过一个给定的输入简单地对其进行验证，确定输出值（或行为）“是”或“不是”该测试用例中所指定的那个期望值。
Test cases are built around specifications and requirements, i.e., what the application is supposed to do.	测试用例是围绕规格说明和要求（例如该应用程序是用来干什么的）建立起来的。
It uses external descriptions of the software, including specifications, requirements, and designs to derive test cases.	通过对软件进行外部描述，包括规格、要求、设计等等，来得出测试用例。
These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional.	这些测试可以是功能性的，也可以是非功能性的，但一般来说都是功能性测试。
Specification-based testing may be necessary to assure correct functionality, but it is insufficient to guard against complex or high-risk situations.	要确保功能的正确性，基于规格说明的测试是很必要的，但这种方法并不足以防止复杂情况或高风险情况的发生。
One advantage of the black box technique is that no programming knowledge is required.	黑盒测试法的一大优势是不需要用到编程知识。
Whatever biases the programmers may have had, the tester likely has a different set and may emphasize different areas of functionality.	不管程序员有着怎样的偏见，测试员的偏见都有可能会与之不一样，所侧重的功能点也可能会不同。
On the other hand, black-box testing has been said to be "like a walk in a dark labyrinth without a flashlight." Because they do not examine the source code, there are situations when a tester writes many test cases to check something that could have been tested by only one test case or leaves some parts of the program untested.	另一方面，黑盒测试被认为是“在黑暗的迷宫中摸黑前行”。由于黑盒测试不检查源代码，因此会存在这样的情况，即本来只用一个测试用例就能测试出来东西，测试员写了很多测试用例来检查；或者该程序有一些部分没有被测试到。
This method of test can be applied to all levels of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance.	该测试方法适用于软件测试的所有级别：单元、集成、系统和验收。
It typically comprises most if not all testing at higher levels, but can also dominate unit testing as well.	它通常囊括绝大多数甚至所有的高级别测试，但在单元测试中也占主导地位。
Component interface testing	组件接口测试
Component interface testing is a variation of black-box testing, with the focus on the data values beyond just the related actions of a subsystem component.	组件接口测试是黑盒测试的一种变体，不仅关注子系统组件的相关操作，还关注数据的值。
The practice of component interface testing can be used to check the handling of data passed between various units, or subsystem components, beyond full integration testing between those units.	组件接口测试除了可以用于各个单元之间的全集成测试，还可以用来检查这些单元或子系统组件之间数据传递的处理情况。
The data being passed can be considered as "message packets" and the range or data types can be checked, for data generated from one unit, and tested for validity before being passed into another unit.	被传递的数据可以看作是“消息包”，可以检查一个单元所生成数据的数据范围或类型，并在传递给下一个单元之前测试其有效性。
One option for interface testing is to keep a separate log file of data items being passed, often with a timestamp logged to allow analysis of thousands of cases of data passed between units for days or weeks.	接口测试的一种选择是为传递的数据项保留一个单独的日志文件，文件通常带有一个时间戳记录，这样就可以对数天或数周内各单元之间传递的数千种数据情况进行分析。
Tests can include checking the handling of some extreme data values while other interface variables are passed as normal values.	测试包括检查某些极端数据值的处理情况，其他接口变量则作为正常的值来传递。
Unusual data values in an interface can help explain unexpected performance in the next unit.	接口处的不寻常数据值可以帮助解释下一个单元的意外行为。
The aim of visual testing is to provide developers with the ability to examine what was happening at the point of software failure by presenting the data in such a way that the developer can easily find the information she or he requires, and the information is expressed clearly.	可视化测试的目的是让开发人员能够检查软件故障点发生了什么，通过呈现数据，开发人员可以很容易地找到他/她所需的信息，而且信息的表达是很清楚的。
At the core of visual testing is the idea that showing someone a problem (or a test failure), rather than just describing it, greatly increases clarity and understanding.	视觉测试的核心概念是向某人展示一个问题（或一次测试失败），而不仅仅是描述这个问题，这大大提高了问题的清晰度及可理解性。
Visual testing, therefore, requires the recording of the entire test process – capturing everything that occurs on the test system in video format.	因此，可视化测试需要录制整个测试过程——以视频的格式捕捉测试系统中所发生的一切。
Output videos are supplemented by real-time tester input via picture-in-a-picture webcam and audio commentary from microphones.	通过画中画摄像以及来自麦克风的音频评论获得实时测试输入，作为输出视频的补充。
Visual testing provides a number of advantages.	可视化测试具有很多优势。
The quality of communication is increased drastically because testers can show the problem (and the events leading up to it) to the developer as opposed to just describing it and the need to replicate test failures will cease to exist in many cases.	可以大大提高沟通质量，因为测试人员可以向开发人员展示问题（以及导致问题的事件），而非仅仅描述问题。多数情况下不再需要一次次去重复测试失败。
The developer will have all the evidence she or he requires of a test failure and can instead focus on the cause of the fault and how it should be fixed.	开发人员获得他/她所需的关于测试失败的所有证据，可以转而专注于错误的原因以及应该如何修复。
Ad hoc testing and exploratory testing are important methodologies for checking software integrity, because they require less preparation time to implement, while the important bugs can be found quickly.	随机测试和探索性测试是检查软件完整性的重要方法，因为这两种方法在执行前需要的准备时间更少，但却能快速地找出重大的 bug。
In ad hoc testing, where testing takes place in an improvised, impromptu way, the ability of the tester(s) to base testing off documented methods and then improvise variations of those tests can result in more rigorous examination of defect fixes.	在随机测试中，测试是以一种临时、即兴的方式进行的，测试人员能够基于文档化的方法进行测试，然后即兴改变这些测试，这样做可以使得对缺陷修复的检查更加严密。
However, unless strict documentation of the procedures are maintained, one of the limits of ad hoc testing is lack of repeatability.	然而，随机测试的不足之一是缺乏可重复性，除非将程序文档严格保存下来。
Grey-box testing (American spelling: gray-box testing) involves having knowledge of internal data structures and algorithms for purposes of designing tests while executing those tests at the user, or black-box level.	在灰盒（grey-box）测试（美式英语中是“gray-box”）中，为了设计测试，需要了解内部数据结构和算法，而且是在用户或黑盒的级别上去执行这些测试。
The tester will often have access to both "the source code and the executable binary." Grey-box testing may also include reverse engineering (using dynamic code analysis) to determine, for instance, boundary values or error messages.	测试人员往往可以访问“源代码和可执行的二进制代码”。灰盒测试还可能会用到逆向工程（利用动态码分析）来确定边界值或错误消息之类的内容。
Manipulating input data and formatting output do not qualify as grey-box, as the input and output are clearly outside of the "black box" that we are calling the system under test.	处理输入数据和格式化输出这两点不属于灰盒，因为输入和输出显然位于我们所谓的“黑盒”（即正在接受测试的系统）之外。
This distinction is particularly important when conducting integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers, where only the interfaces are exposed for the test.	在由两位不同的开发人员所写的两个代码模块之间进行集成测试时，必须在两者之间进行区分，这是尤其重要的，因为这种情况下只在接口这个的地方进行测试。
By knowing the underlying concepts of how the software works, the tester makes better-informed testing choices while testing the software from outside.	了解软件如何工作的底层逻辑之后，测试人员就可以在从外部测试软件时作出更明智的测试选择。
Typically, a grey-box tester will be permitted to set up an isolated testing environment with activities such as seeding a database.	一般来说，灰盒测试人员会被允许利用播种数据库之类的操作建立起一个独立的测试环境。
The tester can observe the state of the product being tested after performing certain actions such as executing SQL statements against the database and then executing queries to ensure that the expected changes have been reflected.	测试人员可以在执行某些操作（例如，对数据库执行 SQL 语句然后执行查询）之后观察被测试产品的状态，以确保预期的更改已经被反应出来。
Grey-box testing implements intelligent test scenarios, based on limited information.	灰盒测试可以基于有限的信息实现智能的测试场景。
This will particularly apply to data type handling, exception handling, and so on.	这一点特别适用于数据类型处理、异常处理等。
Broadly speaking, there are at least three levels of testing: unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.	从广义上说，测试至少可以分为三个级别：单元测试、集成测试以及系统测试。
However, a fourth level, acceptance testing, may be included by developers.	但对开发人员来说，可能还有第四个级别：验收测试。
This may be in the form of operational acceptance testing or be simple end-user (beta) testing, testing to ensure the software meets functional expectations.	它的形式可以是运行验收测试，也可以是简单的终端用户测试（beta 测试），以确保软件的功能与所期待的一致。
Tests are frequently grouped into one of these levels by where they are added in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test.	通常会根据测试在软件开发过程中所加进来的位置，或者根据测试的专门化程度，将其集合成其中的一个级别。
The first people to inhabit the area now known as Sydney were indigenous Australians having migrated from northern Australia and before that from southeast Asia.	第一批搬到现在的悉尼地区的人是澳大利亚原住民，他们从澳大利亚北部迁徙过来，来澳大利亚之前曾居住在东南亚。
Radiocarbon dating suggests human activity first started to occur in the Sydney area from around 30,735 years ago.	放射性碳测定年代法表明，人类活动最早开始于 30735 年前的悉尼地区。
However, numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Western Sydney's gravel sediments that were dated from 45,000 to 50,000 years BP, which would indicate that there was human settlement in Sydney earlier than thought.	然而，人们在西悉尼的砾石沉积物中发现了大量可追溯到 45000 至 50000 年前的原始石器工具，这表明，悉尼有人类定居的时间点比我们想象中的要早。
The first meeting between the native people and the British occurred on 29 April 1770 when Lieutenant James Cook landed at Botany Bay on the Kurnell Peninsula and encountered the Gweagal clan.	1770 年 4 月 29 日，詹姆斯·库克中尉在科内尔半岛的植物学湾登陆时，遇到了格威盖尔部落的人。这是英国人与当地原住民的第一次见面。
He noted in his journal that they were confused and somewhat hostile towards the foreign visitors.	库克在日记中写到，这些原住民看到有外人进来感到很困惑，而且带有敌意。
Cook was on a mission of exploration and was not commissioned to start a settlement.	库克当时正在执行一项探险任务，但没有被委托去建立定居点。
He spent a short time collecting food and conducting scientific observations before continuing further north along the east coast of Australia and claiming the new land he had discovered for Britain.	他花了一小段时间边收集食物边进行科学观察，接着沿澳大利亚东海岸继续北上，宣布自己发现的这片新大陆归英国所有。
Prior to the arrival of the British there were 4,000 to 8,000 native people in Sydney from as many as 29 different clans.	在英国人到来之前，悉尼有 4000 至 8000 名原住民，分属于 29 个不同的部落。
The earliest British settlers called the natives Eora people.	最早的英国殖民者将当地原住民称为“Eora”人。
"Eora" is the term the indigenous population used to explain their origins upon first contact with the British.	“Eora”是当地原住民首次与英国人接触时用来解释自己的出身所用的一个词。
Its literal meaning is "from this place".Sydney Cove from Port Jackson to Petersham was inhabited by the Cadigal clan.	它的字面意思是“来自这个地方”。从杰克逊港至彼得舍姆的悉尼港地区这一带曾居住着凯迪加尔部落。
The principal language groups were Darug, Guringai, and Dharawal.	 他们的主要语系为塔鲁尔语、顾林凯语和塔尔瓦斯语。
The earliest Europeans to visit the area noted that the indigenous people were conducting activities such as camping and fishing, using trees for bark and food, collecting shells, and cooking fish.	最早踏上这片土地的欧洲人注意到，澳大利亚原住民会进行野营、钓鱼、利用树木获得树皮和食物、收集贝壳、烹饪鱼等活动。。
Britain—before that, England—and Ireland had for a long time been sending their convicts across the Atlantic to the American colonies.	很长一段时间以来，英国——在此之前是英格兰——和爱尔兰一直把他们的罪犯送到太平洋彼岸的美洲殖民地。
That trade was ended with the Declaration of Independence by the United States in 1776.	这一交易随着 1776 年美国独立宣言的发布而走向了历史终结。
Britain decided in 1786 to found a new penal outpost in the territory discovered by Cook some 16 years earlier.	1786 年，英国决定在库克 16 年前发现的大陆上设立一个新的罪犯流放地。
Captain Philip led the First Fleet of 11 ships and about 850 convicts into Botany Bay on 18 January 1788, though deemed the location unsuitable due to poor soil and a lack of fresh water.	1788 年 1 月 18 日，飞利浦船长率领由 11 艘船和 850 名囚犯组成的“第一舰队”抵达植物学湾，尽管他认为这个地方土壤贫瘠，淡水资源缺乏，不适合人类居住。
He travelled a short way further north and arrived at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788.	他朝北继续前行了一小段路程，于 1788 年 1 月 26 日抵达悉尼湾。
This was to be the location for the new colony.	这里就是要建立新殖民地的地方。
Phillip described Port Jackson as being "without exception the finest harbour in the world".	菲利普将杰克逊港描述为“世界上无与伦比的最好的港湾”。
The colony was at first to be titled "New Albion" (after Albion, another name for Great Britain), but Phillip decided on "Sydney".	起初，殖民地本来要被命名为“新阿尔比恩”（“阿尔比恩”是英国的另一国名），但菲利普决定用“悉尼”这个名字。
The official proclamation and naming of the colony happened on 7 February 1788.	1788 年 2 月 7 日，殖民地正式宣告成立并进行命名。
Lieutenant William Dawes produced a town plan in 1790 but it was ignored by the colony's leaders.	威廉·道斯中尉 1790 年时曾制定过一份城市规划方案，但殖民地的领导层不以为意。
Sydney's layout today reflects this lack of planning.	悉尼今天的城市布局就反映出了当年城市规划的缺位。
Between 1788 and 1792, 3,546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney—many "professional criminals" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790.	1788 年至 1792 年期间，共有 3546 名男囚犯和 766 名女囚犯在悉尼登陆——很多“专业囚犯”几乎不具备开拓殖民地所需的技能。1790 年，该地粮食形势告急。
Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce.	早期的农业生产非常糟糕，来自海外的物资供应也非常稀少。
From 1791 on, however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.	然而，从 1791 年起，开始有船只更频繁地抵达悉尼，贸易也开始发展起来，这减轻了大家的孤立感，也改善了物资供应。
The colony was not founded on the principles of freedom and prosperity.	殖民地不是建立在自由和繁荣的原则上的。
Maps from this time show no prison buildings; the punishment for convicts was transportation rather than incarceration, but serious offences were penalised by flogging and hanging.	这一时期的地图并没有标示监狱，意味着对罪犯的惩罚不是囚禁而是流放。但重大罪犯会受到鞭笞和绞刑的惩罚。
Phillip sent exploratory missions in search of better soils and fixed on the Parramatta region as a promising area for expansion and moved many of the convicts from late 1788 to establish a small township, which became the main centre of the colony's economic life, leaving Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life.	菲利普发布各项探索任务让大家去寻找更好的土地，最终定于帕拉玛塔这个地区，认为在这里进行扩张很有前景，并自 1788 年底起将众多犯人送到这里来建立起一个小城镇。这个小城镇变成了殖民地主要的经济生活中心，悉尼湾只用作重要港口和社会活动中心。
Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and Toongabbie, but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily.	虽然设备的简陋以及对当地土壤和气候不熟悉仍然威胁着从农场湾到帕拉玛塔和图龙加比的农业发展，但在罪犯劳动力的帮助下，一个城镇规划方案在稳步推进。
Officers and convicts alike faced starvation as supplies ran low and little could be cultivated from the land.	物资供应不足，农业收成少，导致军官和囚犯都面临着饥饿的困境。
The region's indigenous population was also suffering.	该地区的原住民也同样不好过。
It is estimated that half of the native people in Sydney died during the smallpox epidemic of 1789.	据估计，悉尼有一半的原住民死于 1789 年爆发的天花。
Enlightened for his age, Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony.	受所处时代启发，菲利普本人打算与当地原住民建立和谐的关系，试图改革并管教好殖民地的囚犯。
Phillip and several of his officers – most notably Watkin Tench – left behind journals and accounts which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement.	菲利普和他手下的几个军官——其中沃特金·坦奇最为有名——留下了日记和记录，讲述了殖民之初那几年所遭遇到的巨大困难。
Part of Macquarie's effort to transform the colony was his authorisation for convicts to re-enter society as free citizens.	麦格理对殖民地改革作出了诸多努力，其中一项是授权囚犯以自由公民的身份重新进入社会。
Roads, bridges, wharves, and public buildings were constructed using convict labour and by 1822 the town had banks, markets, and well-established thoroughfares.	利用罪犯劳动力，该城镇建立起了道路、桥梁、码头和公共建筑。到 1822 年，这里已经有银行、市场和建设良好的街道。
Parramatta Road was opened in 1811, which is one of Sydney's oldest roads and Australia's first highway between two cities – Sydney CBD and Parramatta.	帕拉玛塔路于 1811 年开通，是悉尼最古老的公路之一，也是澳大利亚境内连接悉尼市中心和帕拉玛塔的首条高速公路。
Conditions in the colony were not conducive to the development of a thriving new metropolis, but the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of maritime trade (such as wool) helped to lessen the burden of isolation.	虽然殖民地的条件不利于一个新兴大都会的发展，但船只更加频繁地抵达以及海上贸易（如羊毛）的兴起使这里不再那么与世隔绝。

The New Zealand Parliament holds legislative power and consists of the Queen and the House of Representatives.	新西兰议会由女王和众议院组成，拥有立法权。
It also included an upper house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950.	新西兰议会还包含上院，即立法委员会，但于 1950 年被废除。
The supremacy of parliament over the Crown and other government institutions was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand.	1689 年英国的《权利法案》确立了议会的权力高于国王及其他政府机构，后在新西兰被批准为法律。
The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats.	众议院是民主选举产生的，由拥有多数席位的政党或政党联盟组成政府。
If no majority is formed, a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured.	如果没有多数党，则组成少数党政府，但要确保信任投票和补选投票期间得到其他政党的支持。
The governor-general appoints ministers under advice from the prime minister, who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition.	总督在总理的建议下任命部长，而总理一般是执政党或执政联盟的议会领袖。
Cabinet, formed by ministers and led by the prime minister, is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions.	内阁由部长组成，由首相领导，是政府的最高决策机构，负责为政府的重大行为作出决策。
Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively, and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions.	内阁成员集体作出重大决策并共同对这些决策的后果负责。
A parliamentary general election must be called no later than three years after the previous election.	议会大选距离上一次大选的时间不得超过 3 年。
Almost all general elections between 1853 and 1993 were held under the first-past-the-post voting system.	从 1853 年到 1993 年，几乎所有的大选都实行简单多数选举制。
Since the 1996 election, a form of proportional representation called mixed-member proportional (MMP) has been used.	自 1996 年的选举以来，新西兰一直实行一种比例代表选举制度，叫“混合成员比例制（MMP）”。
Under the MMP system, each person has two votes; one is for a candidate standing in the voter's electorate and the other is for a party.	在 MMP 制度下，每个人有两张选票，一张用于选出选民所在选区的候选人，一张用于选举政党。
Since the 2014 election, there have been 71 electorates (which include seven Māori electorates in which only Māori can optionally vote), and the remaining 49 of the 120 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote, with the threshold that a party must win at least one electorate or 5% of the total party vote before it is eligible for a seat.	自 2014 年选举以来，新西兰被划分为  71 个选区（其中包括 7 个毛利人选区，这种选区只有毛利人有投票选择权），120 个译员席位中剩下下的 49 个席位根据政党得票比率分配，这样议会代表情况就能反映出政党得票情况。一个政党必须至少赢得一个选区，或政党得票率至少为 5%，才有资格获得席位。
Elections since the 1930s have been dominated by two political parties, National and Labour.	自 20 世纪 30 年代以来，新西兰的选举一直由两个政党主宰：国家党和工党。
Between March 2005 and August 2006, New Zealand became the first country in the world in which all the highest offices in the land—head of state, governor-general, prime minister, speaker and chief justice—were occupied simultaneously by women.	2005 年 3 月到 2006 年 8 月期间，新西兰成为世界上第一个所有最高国家职位——国家元首、总督、总理、议长和首席法官——均同时由女性担任的国家。
The current prime minister is Jacinda Ardern, who has been in office since 26 October 2017.	 现任总理是 2017 年 10 月 26 日上任的杰辛达·阿德恩。
She is the country's third female prime minister.	她是这个国家的第三任女总理。
New Zealand's judiciary, headed by the chief justice, includes the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts.	新西兰的司法系统以首席法官为首，由最高法院、上诉法院、高等法院以及初级法院组成。
Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence.	法官和司法官员的任命是非政治性的，他们的任期有着严格的规定，这样有助于维护司法独立。
This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions.	理论上这样可以允许司法部门只根据议会颁布的立法进行法律解释，在做出决策时无需受到其他因素的影响。
New Zealand is identified as one of the world's most stable and well-governed states.	新西兰被认为是世界上最稳定、管理最好的国家之一。
As at 2017, the country was ranked fourth in the strength of its democratic institutions, and first in government transparency and lack of corruption.	截至 2017 年，该国在民主制度实力方面名列第四，在政府透明度和反腐方面名列第一。
A 2017 Human Rights Report by the U.S. Department of State noted that the government generally respected the rights of individuals, but voiced concerns regarding the social status of the Māori population.	美国国务院发布的一份《 2017 年国别人权报告》表示新西兰政府大体上做到了尊重人权，但同时也表示毛利人的社会地位令人堪忧。
New Zealand ranks highly for civic participation in the political process, with 77% voter turnout during recent elections, compared to an OECD average of 69%.	新西兰在公民参与政治事务方面排名靠前，在最近的选举中，有 77% 的公民参与了投票，相比之下，经合组织国家的公民选举参与度平均只有 69%。
Early colonial New Zealand allowed the British Government to determine external trade and be responsible for foreign policy.	殖民地早期的新西兰允许英国决定对外贸易事务并对外交政策负责。
The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan.	1923 年和 1926 年的帝国会议决定新西兰应有权自行商讨本国政治条约。1928 年，新西兰与日本签订了第一个商业条约。
On 3 September 1939 New Zealand allied itself with Britain and declared war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage proclaiming, "Where she goes, we go; where she stands, we stand."	1939 年 9月3日，新西兰与英国一道对德宣战。总理迈克尔·约瑟夫·萨维奇甚至扬言：“英国去哪我们就去哪，英国的立场就是我们的立场。”
In 1951 the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European interests, while New Zealand joined Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty.	1951 年，正当英国越来越专注于本国的欧洲利益时，新西兰与澳大利亚、美国一道，签订了《澳新美安全条约》。
The influence of the United States on New Zealand weakened following protests over the Vietnam War, the refusal of the United States to admonish France after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues and New Zealand's nuclear-free policy.	美越战争引发了抗议，彩虹勇士号沉没后美国拒绝劝诫法国，再加上两国在环境和农业贸易上的分歧以及新西兰的无核政策，所有这些因素加起来削弱了美国对新西兰的影响。
Despite the United States' suspension of ANZUS obligations the treaty remained in effect between New Zealand and Australia, whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend.	尽管美国方面暂停执行《澳新美安全条约》中的义务，但该条约在新西兰和澳大利亚之间仍然有效，两国的外交政策也一直沿用着类似的做法。
Close political contact is maintained between the two countries, with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit, live and work in both countries without restrictions.	两国之间一直保持着密切的政治联系，签订了各种自由贸易协定和旅行安排协议，两国公民可以自由前往对方国家访问、生活和工作，毫无限制。
In 2013 there were about 650,000 New Zealand citizens living in Australia, which is equivalent to 15% of the resident population of New Zealand.	2013 年大概有 65 万新西兰公民居住在澳大利亚，相当于新西兰常住人口的 15%。
New Zealand has a strong presence among the Pacific Island countries.	新西兰在太平洋岛国中具有举足轻重的影响力。
A large proportion of New Zealand's aid goes to these countries and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment.	新西兰的对外援助大部分流向这些国家，而这些国家也有很多人移民到新西兰就业。
Permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access Category, which allow up to 1,100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year.	永久性移民受到 1970 年萨摩亚配额计划和 2002 年太平洋准入类别的管制，每年只允许至多 1100 名萨摩亚人和 750 名其他太平洋岛国居民成为新西兰永久居民。

In computing, a printer is a peripheral device which makes a persistent representation of graphics or text on paper.	在计算机技术中，打印机是一种外围设备，能使图像或文本持久地显示在纸张上。
While most output is human-readable, bar code printers are an example of an expanded use for printers.	大多数打印机的输出都是可读的，而条形码打印机是对打印机进行扩展使用的一个例子。
The first computer printer designed was a mechanically driven apparatus by Charles Babbage for his difference engine in the 19th century; however, his mechanical printer design was not built until 2000.	人类设计的第一台计算机打印机是 19 世纪查尔斯·巴贝奇为他的差分机所设计的一台机械驱动设备，但直到 2000 年，他设计的机械打印机才被人制造出来。
The first electronic printer was the EP-101, invented by Japanese company Epson and released in 1968.	第一台电子打印机是 1968 年由日本公司 Epson 发明并推出的 EP-101。
The first commercial printers generally used mechanisms from electric typewriters and Teletype machines.	第一批商用打印机大体上利用了电动打字机和电传打字机中的机制。
The demand for higher speed led to the development of new systems specifically for computer use.	对更高速度的要求促使人们开发出了专门在计算机上使用的新系统。
In the 1980s there were daisy wheel systems similar to typewriters, line printers that produced similar output but at much higher speed, and dot matrix systems that could mix text and graphics but produced relatively low-quality output.	20 世纪 80 年代，市面上出现了类似于打字机的菊花轮打印机系统、输出效果与打字机相似但速度更快的行式打印机以及可以混合文本和图形一起输出但输出质量较低的点阵式打印机。
The plotter was used for those requiring high quality line art like blueprints.	绘图机则用于高质量艺术线条的绘制，比如蓝图。
The introduction of the low-cost laser printer in 1984 with the first HP LaserJet, and the addition of PostScript in next year's Apple LaserWriter, set off a revolution in printing known as desktop publishing.	1984 年，惠普推出了一款低成本激光打印机——惠普 Laser jet 一代。次年，苹果在其激光打印机 Apple LaserWriter 中添加了 PostScript ，由此掀起了一场印刷革命，即所谓的桌面出版。
Laser printers using PostScript mixed text and graphics, like dot-matrix printers, but at quality levels formerly available only from commercial typesetting systems.	和点阵式打印机一样，使用 postscript 语言的激光打印机可以混合文本和图像，但论其输出质量，在此之前只有商业排字机才有这样的水准。
By 1990, most simple printing tasks like fliers and brochures were now created on personal computers and then laser printed; expensive offset printing systems were being dumped as scrap.	到 1990 年，传单和宣传册等大多数简单的打印任务都是在个人电脑上完成，然后由激光打印机打印，而价格昂贵的胶印系统则遭到了遗弃。
The HP Deskjet of 1988 offered the same advantages as a laser printer in terms of flexibility, but produced somewhat lower quality output (depending on the paper) from much less expensive mechanisms.	1988 年的惠普 Deskjet 在灵活性方面有着与激光打印机相同的优势，其构造在价格上要便宜很多，但输出质量稍差（取决于纸张）。
Inkjet systems rapidly displaced dot matrix and daisy wheel printers from the market.	喷墨式打印机迅速占领了点阵式打印机和菊花轮打印机的市场。
By the 2000s high-quality printers of this sort had fallen under the $100 price point and became commonplace.	到 21 世纪初，类似的高质量打印机已降至 100 美元以下，用的人开始多了起来。
The rapid update of internet email through the 1990s and into the 2000s has largely displaced the need for printing as a means of moving documents, and a wide variety of reliable storage systems means that a "physical backup" is of little benefit today.	从上世纪 90 年代到本世纪头10 年，日新月异的互联网电子邮件使得人们很多时候不再需要把文件打印出来带走，而各种各样可靠的储存系统的存在也意味着“物理备份”在如今已经没什么太大作用。
Even the desire for printed output for "offline reading" while on mass transit or aircraft has been displaced by e-book readers and tablet computers.	即便想在公共交通或飞机上进行离线阅读，人们也不会打印出来，而是带上电子阅读器或平板电脑。
Today, traditional printers are being used more for special purposes, like printing photographs or artwork, and are no longer a must-have peripheral.	如今，传统的打印机更多是用于一些特殊用途，如打印照片或艺术品，不再是一种不可或缺的外围设备。
Starting around 2010, 3D printing became an area of intense interest, allowing the creation of physical objects with the same sort of effort as an early laser printer required to produce a brochure.	大约从 2010 年开始，3D 打印开始变得火热，这种打印机可以像早期的激光打印机打印宣传册那样打印出实物。
These devices are in their earliest stages of development and have not yet become commonplace.	这种设备目前处于发展早期，尚未得到大规模使用。
Personal printers are primarily designed to support individual users, and may be connected to only a single computer.	个人打印机主要是为支持个人用户而设计，可能会只连接到一台计算机上。
These printers are designed for low-volume, short-turnaround print jobs, requiring minimal setup time to produce a hard copy of a given document.	这些打印机专为量小、低速的打印任务而设计，只需最少的设置时间就能将给定文件的复印件制作出来。
However, they are generally slow devices ranging from 6 to around 25 pages per minute (ppm),	但这种打印机的速度普遍很慢，打印速度为每分钟 6 页到 25 页（ppm）。
and the cost per page is relatively high.	平均每一页的打印成本也相对较高。
However, this is offset by the on-demand convenience.	但它胜在方便，想用就能直接用。
Some printers can print documents stored on memory cards or from digital cameras and scanners.	有些打印机可以打印存在记忆卡里或数码相机和扫描仪上的文件。
Networked or shared printers are "designed for high-volume, high-speed printing".	网络打印机或共享打印机是“用来实现量大、高速的打印任务的”。
They are usually shared by many users on a network and can print at speeds of 45 to around 100 ppm.	它们通常可以为网络上的许多用户共享，打印速度在每分钟 45 页到 100 页之间。
The Xerox 9700 could achieve 120 ppm.	Xerox 9700 打印机的速度可以达到每分钟 120 页。
A virtual printer is a piece of computer software whose user interface and API resembles that of a printer driver, but which is not connected with a physical computer printer.	虚拟打印机是一种计算机软件，其用户接口和 API 类似于打印驱动程序的接口和 API，只是不和实际的计算机打印机连接。
A virtual printer can be used to create a file which is an image of the data which would be printed, for archival purposes or as input to another program, for example to create a PDF or to transmit to another system or user.	虚拟打印机可以通过将要打印的数据存为图像来生成一个图像文件，该图像用于存档或作为另一程序的输入，例如，生成一个 PDF 文件，或传给另一个系统或用户。
A barcode printer is a computer peripheral for printing barcode labels or tags that can be attached to, or printed directly on, physical objects.	条形码打印机是一种计算机外围设备，用于打印条形码贴纸或标签，可以打印出来贴在实物上，也可以直接在实物上打印。
Barcode printers are commonly used to label cartons before shipment, or to label retail items with UPCs or EANs.	条形码打印机通常用于出货前打印出标签贴在纸箱上，或在零售商品上打印 UPC 码 或 EAN 码。
A 3D printer is a device for making a three-dimensional object from a 3D model or other electronic data source through additive processes in which successive layers of material (including plastics, metals, food, cement, wood, and other materials) are laid down under computer control.	3D 打印机是一种以 3D 模型或其他数据源为基础构建出三维物体的设备，其制作过程是在电脑的控制下通过层层叠加，将材料（塑料、金属、食品、水泥、木材或其他）一层一层加上去。
It is called a printer by analogy with an inkjet printer which produces a two-dimensional document by a similar process of depositing a layer of ink on paper.	被称为打印机是因为这种设备与喷墨打印机的运行过程类似，只不过喷墨打印机是把一层墨水打到纸上，制作出二维的文件。
The choice of print technology has a great effect on the cost of the printer and cost of operation, speed, quality and permanence of documents, and noise.	打印技术的选择对打印机的购买成本、操作成本、速度、文件质量及持久性、噪音都有很大影响。
Some printer technologies do not work with certain types of physical media, such as carbon paper or transparencies.	有些打印机技术对某些类型的物理介质是不适用的，如复写纸或透明胶片等。
A second aspect of printer technology that is often forgotten is resistance to alteration: liquid ink, such as from an inkjet head or fabric ribbon, becomes absorbed by the paper fibers, so documents printed with liquid ink are more difficult to alter than documents printed with toner or solid inks, which do not penetrate below the paper surface.	打印机技术还有一个方面常常会被人们遗忘：抗改性。喷墨头或丝织色带上的液体油墨会被纸的纤维吸收，因此，用液体墨水打印出来的文件比用墨粉或固体墨打印出来的文件更难更改，因为墨粉或固体墨不会渗透到纸张表面以下。
Cheques can be printed with liquid ink or on special cheque paper with toner anchorage so that alterations may be detected.	支票可以用液体墨水打印，也可以印在固定了墨粉的特殊支票纸上，这样如果发生涂改就可以检测出来。
The machine-readable lower portion of a cheque must be printed using MICR toner or ink.	支票的下半部分是要被机器读取的，因此这部分必须使用 MICR 墨粉或墨水打印。
Banks and other clearing houses employ automation equipment that relies on the magnetic flux from these specially printed characters to function properly.	银行和其他票据交换所所采用的自动化设备就是依靠这些特殊印刷字符所产生的磁通量来正常运行的。
The following printing technologies are routinely found in modern printers:	以下是现代打印机常用的打印技术：
A laser printer rapidly produces high quality text and graphics.	激光打印机可以迅速打印出高质量的文本和图像。
As with digital photocopiers and multifunction printers (MFPs), laser printers employ a xerographic printing process but differ from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of a laser beam across the printer's photoreceptor.	与数字复印机和多功能打印机（MFPs）一样，激光打印机采用的也是静电印刷的打印过程，但与模拟影印机不同的地方在于，激光打印机的图像是激光光束直接扫描打印机的感光器产生的。
Another toner-based printer is the LED printer which uses an array of LEDs instead of a laser to cause toner adhesion to the print drum.	另一种基于墨粉的打印机是 LED 打印机，这种打印机利用 LED 阵列而非激光来致使墨粉粘附到打印鼓上。
Inkjet printers operate by propelling variably sized droplets of liquid ink onto almost any sized page.	喷墨打印机的工作原理是将大小不一的液体墨滴喷到印纸上，印纸可以是任何尺寸。
They are the most common type of computer printer used by consumers.	这是消费者最常用的一种电脑打印机。
Solid ink printers, also known as phase-change printers, are a type of thermal transfer printer.	固体墨打印机也称相变打印机，是一种热转印打印机。
They use solid sticks of CMYK-coloured ink, similar in consistency to candle wax, which are melted and fed into a piezo crystal operated print-head.	这种打印机使用 CMYK 色固态墨棒，稠度类似于蜡烛，融化后注入有压电晶体运行的打印头中。
The printhead sprays the ink on a rotating, oil coated drum.	打印头将油墨喷在一个正在旋转的涂了油的硒鼓上。
The paper then passes over the print drum, at which time the image is immediately transferred, or transfixed, to the page.	然后打印纸经过打印鼓，此时，图像就会立即被转到打印纸上或定在打印纸上。
Solid ink printers are most commonly used as colour office printers, and are excellent at printing on transparencies and other non-porous media.	固体墨打印机是最常用的办公室彩印机，可以在透明胶片之类的无孔介质上出色地打印。
Solid ink printers can produce excellent results.	固体墨打印机的打印效果非常好。
Acquisition and operating costs are similar to laser printers.	购置成本和操作成本与激光打印机相差无几。
Drawbacks of the technology include high energy consumption and long warm-up times from a cold state.	这种技术的不足之处包括高能耗、低温状态下预热时间过长等。
Also, some users complain that the resulting prints are difficult to write on, as the wax tends to repel inks from pens, and are difficult to feed through automatic document feeders, but these traits have been significantly reduced in later models.	此外，有用户表示这种打印机打印出的材料不好写东西，因为蜡会排斥笔头的墨，而且很难利用自动文件传送器传送打印纸。不过这些弊端在后面的型号中已经得到大幅度改善。
In addition, this type of printer is only available from one manufacturer, Xerox, manufactured as part of their Xerox Phaser office printer line.	此外，这种类型的打印机目前只有一家公司能生产：施乐。固体墨打印机是施乐移相办公打印机系列的其中一款。
Previously, solid ink printers were manufactured by Tektronix, but Tek sold the printing business to Xerox in 2001.	固体墨打印机之前是由泰克公司生产的，但泰克在 2001 年将打印机业务卖给了施乐。
A dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a printer which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, paper or canvas.	染料升华打印机（热升华打印机）采用的打印过程是通过热的作用将染料转移到塑料卡、纸张或画布等打印介质上。
The process is usually to lay one colour at a time using a ribbon that has colour panels.	它的打印过程通常就是利用一个带有色块的色带，一次铺一种颜色。
Dye-sub printers are intended primarily for high-quality colour applications, including colour photography; and are less well-suited for text.	热升华打印机主要用于彩色照片等高质量的彩打，不太适合用来打印文本。
While once the province of high-end print shops, dye-sublimation printers are now increasingly used as dedicated consumer photo printers.	热升华打印机曾经是高端印刷店的专属，但现在被越来越多的消费者专门买来打印照片。
Thermal printers work by selectively heating regions of special heat-sensitive paper.	热敏打印机的工作原理是有选择地在热敏打印纸的确定区域上加热。
Monochrome thermal printers are used in cash registers, ATMs, gasoline dispensers and some older inexpensive fax machines.	单色热敏打印机用于收银机、自动取款机、自助加油机和一些老式的廉价传真机上。
Colours can be achieved with special papers and different temperatures and heating rates for different colours; these coloured sheets are not required in black-and-white output.	彩色打印可以利用特殊的纸张通过不同的温度、加热速度来实现各种颜色，黑白打印则不需要用到这些彩印纸。
One example is Zink (a portmanteau of "zero ink").	其中一个例子是 Zink（“zero ink”的合成词）。
The following technologies are either obsolete, or limited to special applications though most were, at one time, in widespread use.	以下技术要么不合时宜了，要么只能在特殊情况下使用，尽管其中绝大部分都曾经被广泛使用过。
Impact printers rely on a forcible impact to transfer ink to the media.	冲击式打印机依靠一种强大的冲击力将油墨转移到打印介质上。
The impact printer uses a print head that either hits the surface of the ink ribbon, pressing the ink ribbon against the paper (similar to the action of a typewriter), or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the ink ribbon (the IBM 1403 for example).	击打式打印机利用一个打印头，这个打印头要么会打到墨带表面，将墨带压在纸上（类似于打字机的动作），要么打到纸的背面，将纸压在墨带上（例如 IBM1403 打印机），不过这种情况不多。
All but the dot matrix printer rely on the use of fully formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing.	除点阵式打印机外，所有的打印机都依赖全形字符，全形字符是一种字母形式，表示打印机能够打印的所有字符。
In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although bolding and underlining of text could be done by "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or slightly offset.	此外，这些打印机大多局限于单色，偶尔是双色，一次只能打印一种字样。不过，文本的粗体和下划线可以通过“加粗”来实现，也就是在同一字符位置打两个或两个以上的印，或者稍微转印一下。
Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisywheel printers, dot matrix printers and line printers.	击打式打印机的种类包括打字机衍生打印机，电传打字机衍生打印机、菊花轮打印机、点阵式打印机以及行式打印机。
Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed.	点阵式打印机依然普遍用于需要打印多联表格的业务中。
An overview of impact printing contains a detailed description of many of the technologies used.	对击打式打印的概述包含了对许多已有技术的详细描述。
Several different computer printers were simply computer-controllable versions of existing electric typewriters.	有几种不同的电脑打印机只是现有电动打字机的电脑控制版本。
The Friden Flexowriter and IBM Selectric-based printers were the most-common examples.	Friden 的 Flexowriter 打印机以及基于IBM Selectric 的各种打印机是最常见的两个例子。
The Flexowriter printed with a conventional typebar mechanism while the Selectric used IBM's well-known "golf ball" printing mechanism.	Flexowriter 打印机利用传统的铅字条印刷法，而  Selectric 打印机则利用 IBM 著名的“高尔夫球”打印法。
In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon which was pressed against the paper, printing one character at a time.	两种设备都是字体碰到一条压到打印纸上的墨带，一次打印出一个字。
The maximum speed of the Selectric printer (the faster of the two) was 15.5 characters per second.	Selectric 打印机（二者中速度较快者）的最高打印速度是每秒 15.5 个字。
The common teleprinter could easily be interfaced to the computer and became very popular except for those computers manufactured by IBM.	普通的电传打字机很容易连接到电脑（除了 IBM 生产的电脑）上，因此在市面上很流行。
Some models used a "typebox" that was positioned, in the X- and Y-axes, by a mechanism and the selected letter form was struck by a hammer.	有些机型会用到“活字箱”，以一个机械装置将活字箱固定在 X 轴和 Y 轴上，被选中的字体则会遭到锤子的敲击。
Others used a type cylinder in a similar way as the Selectric typewriters used their type ball.	有些则用到活字筒，方法与 Selectric 打字机中使用打印球的方法类似。
In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon to print the letterform.	两种情况下字体都会碰到墨带，打印出该字体。
Most teleprinters operated at ten characters per second although a few achieved 15 CPS.	大多数电传打印机的打印速度是每秒 10 个字，但也有少数达到每秒 15 个字。
Daisy wheel printers operate in much the same fashion as a typewriter.	菊花轮打印机的运行方式和打字机十分相似。
A hammer strikes a wheel with petals, the "daisy wheel", each petal containing a letter form at its tip.	锤子敲击具有花瓣的轮子，也即“菊花轮”，每个花瓣末端都有一个字体。
The letter form strikes a ribbon of ink, depositing the ink on the page and thus printing a character.	字体碰到墨带，将墨打在纸张页面上，这样就打印出了一个字。
By rotating the daisy wheel, different characters are selected for printing.	通过旋转菊花轮，可以选择不同的字体进行打印。
These printers were also referred to as letter-quality printers because they could produce text which was as clear and crisp as a typewriter.	这些打字机也被称为优质字符打印机，因为它们可以打印出像打字机一样清楚明确的文本。
The fastest letter-quality printers printed at 30 characters per second.	最快的优质字符打印机可以每秒钟打印 30 个字。
Liquid ink electrostatic printers use a chemical coated paper, which is charged by the print head according to the image of the document.	液墨静电打印机使用有化学涂层的纸张，根据打印文件的图像通过打印头对纸张进行充电。
The paper is passed near a pool of liquid ink with the opposite charge.	纸张会被传到带有相反电荷的液体墨池附近。
The charged areas of the paper attract the ink and thus form the image.	纸上的带电区域会吸附油墨，从而形成图像。
This process was developed from the process of electrostatic copying.	这一工艺是由静电复制技术发展而来。
Color reproduction is very accurate, and because there is no heating the scale distortion is less than ±0.1%.	它的色彩再现非常准确，而且由于没有加热，图像比例失真低于 ±0.1%。

Shampoo (/ʃæmˈpuː/) is a hair care product, typically in the form of a viscous liquid, that is used for cleaning hair.	洗发水 （英文叫 Shampoo，发音/ʃæmˈpuː/） 是一种头发护理产品， 通常呈粘稠液状，用于清洗头发。
Less commonly, shampoo is available in bar form, like a bar of soap.	有时候，洗发水会做成条状出售，像一条肥皂那样。不过这种情况较少。
Shampoo is used by applying it to wet hair, massaging the product into the hair, and then rinsing it out.	洗发水的使用方法是抹在打湿的头发上，按摩一下将其揉进头发里，然后用水冲洗干净。
Some users may follow a shampooing with the use of hair conditioner.	一些人可能还会用护发素再洗一遍。
The typical reason of using shampoo is to remove the unwanted build-up of sebum in the hair without stripping out so much as to make hair unmanageable.	用洗发水洗头通常是为了清除头发中积聚过多的皮脂，但又不能清除过度，以免头发难以梳理。
Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water.	洗发水通常是由一种表面活性剂（一般为十二烷基硫酸钠，也称月桂醇聚醚硫酸钠）和一种助表面活性剂（一般为椰油酰胺丙基甜菜碱）在水中混合而制成。
The sulphate ingredient acts as a surfactant, essentially heavy duty soap that makes it easier to trap oil and grease.	该硫酸盐成分起到表面活性剂的作用，本质上是一种结实耐用的肥皂，有助于更好地吸走油脂。
Specialty shampoos are marketed to people with dandruff, color-treated hair, gluten or wheat allergies, an interest in using an organic product, and infants and young children ("baby shampoo" is less irritating).	专业洗发水的销售对象是头屑较多者、染发者、对麸质或小麦过敏者、对使用有机产品有兴趣者以及婴幼儿（“宝宝洗发水”的刺激性会小一些）。
There are also shampoos intended for animals that may contain insecticides or other medications to treat skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas.	也有专门针对动物的洗发水，这种洗发水可能含有杀虫剂或其他药物，用于治疗皮肤问题或跳蚤等寄生虫感染。
The word shampoo entered the English language from the Indian subcontinent during the colonial era.	“shampoo”一词于殖民时期由印度次大陆传入英国。
It dates to 1762 and is derived from Hindi chāmpo (चाँपो [tʃãːpoː]), itself derived from the Sanskrit root chapati (चपति), which means to press, knead, soothe.	这个词可追溯到 1762 年，源自印地语中的“chāmpo（चाँपो [tʃãːpoː]）”, 而这个印地语单词本身又源自梵语的词根“ chapati（चपति）”, 意为按压、揉捏、抚慰。
In the Indian subcontinent, a variety of herbs and their extracts have been used as shampoos since ancient times.	在印度次大陆，各种各样的草药及其提取物自古以来就被用作洗发水。
A very effective early shampoo was made by boiling Sapindus with dried Indian gooseberry (amla) and a selection of other herbs, using the strained extract.	早期有一种非常有效的洗发水是将无患子与晒干的印度猕猴桃（alma）以及其他精选的草药放在一起煮沸然后过滤提取出来的。
Sapindus, also known as soapberries or soapnuts, a tropical tree widespread in India, is called ksuna (Sanskrit: क्षुण) in ancient Indian texts and its fruit pulp contains saponins which are a natural surfactant.	无患子，又称木患子、油患子，是一种广泛分布在印度的热带树木，在古印度典籍中被称为 ksuna（梵语: क्षुण），果肉含有皂苷，是一种天然的表面活性剂。
The extract of soapberries creates a lather which Indian texts called phenaka (Sanskrit: फेनक).	无患子的提取物会产生一种在印度典籍中叫做“phenaka（梵语：फेनक）”的泡沫。
It leaves the hair soft, shiny and manageable.	它可以使头发柔软，有光泽，易于打理。
Other products used for hair cleansing were shikakai (Acacia concinna), hibiscus flowers, ritha (Sapindus mukorossi) and arappu (Albizzia amara).	其他用于头发清洁的产品还有头发果子（Acacia concinna）、洛神花、 无患子果（Sapindus mukorossi）以及合欢花（Albizzia amara）。
Guru Nanak, the founder and the first Guru of Sikhism, made references to soapberry tree and soap in the 16th century.	锡克教的创教人兼锡克教第一位古鲁纳纳克在 16 世纪曾提到过无患子树和肥皂。
Cleansing with hair and body massage (champu) during one's daily bath was an indulgence of early colonial traders in India.	每天沐浴时用头发和身体清洁剂（champu）来清洁是早期印度殖民地商人的一大嗜好。
When they returned to Europe, they introduced the newly learned habits, including the hair treatment they called shampoo.	当他们回到欧洲，他们这一新习惯也随之被传了过来，包括头发护理法也被带回，他们称之为“香波”。
Sake Dean Mahomed, an Indian traveller, surgeon, and entrepreneur, is credited with introducing the practice of champooi or "shampooing" to Britain.	米克尔·恩迪·穆罕默德是印度的一位旅行家兼外科医生兼企业家，人们认为是他把“shampooing（香波）”的做法带进了英国。
In 1814, Mahomed, with his Irish wife Jane Daly, opened the first commercial "shampooing" vapour masseur bath in England, in Brighton.	1814 年，穆罕默德和他的爱尔兰妻子简·戴莉在英国布莱顿开了第一家商业“香波”蒸汽按摩洗浴店。
He described the treatment in a local paper as "The Indian Medicated Vapour Bath (type of Turkish bath), a cure to many diseases and giving full relief when everything fails; particularly Rheumatic and paralytic, gout, stiff joints, old sprains, lame legs, aches and pains in the joints".	他在当地的一份报纸上将这种护理法描述为“印度药物蒸汽浴（蒸气浴是土耳其的一种沐浴法），可以治愈多种疾病，能在你到处求医无果时帮你彻底脱离苦海，特别是对于风湿病、麻痹症、痛风、关节僵硬、陈年扭伤、跛腿、各种疼痛以及和关节疼痛。”
During the early stages of shampoo in Europe, English hair stylists boiled shaved soap in water and added herbs to give the hair shine and fragrance.	在洗发水被引进英国早期，英国的发型师把肥皂削成片放在水里煮沸，然后加入草药来使头发变香且有光泽。
Commercially made shampoo was available from the turn of the 20th century.	20 世纪初起，市面上开始出现商业性质的洗发水。
A 1914 advertisement for Canthrox Shampoo in American Magazine showed young women at camp washing their hair with Canthrox in a lake; magazine advertisements in 1914 by Rexall featured Harmony Hair Beautifier and Shampoo.	1914 年，《美国杂志》刊登了一则 Canthrox 洗发水广告，广告中年轻的女士在营地上用 Canthrox 洗发水在湖中洗头。而 1914 年 Rexall 公司在杂志上刊登的洗发水广告则主打“Hamony 系列美发洗发用品”。
In 1927, liquid shampoo was invented by German inventor Hans Schwarzkopf in Berlin, whose name created a shampoo brand sold in Europe.	1927 年，德国发明家汉斯·施华蔻在柏林发明了液体洗发水，他的名字成为该款洗发水在欧洲市场销售的品牌名。
Originally, soap and shampoo were very similar products; both containing the same naturally derived surfactants, a type of detergent.	一开始，肥皂和洗发水这两种产品是非常相似的，两者都含有相同的天然表面活性剂，而表面活性剂是一种洗涤剂。
Modern shampoo as it is known today was first introduced in the 1930s with Drene, the first shampoo using synthetic surfactants instead of soap.	我们今天所熟悉的现代洗发水的初代是 20 世纪 30 年代推出的 Drene 洗发水，这是第一款使用合成表面活性剂代替肥皂的洗发水。
Early shampoos used in Indonesia were made from the husk and straw (merang) of rice.	早期在印尼，人们使用的洗发水是由稻壳和秸秆（merang）制成的。
The husks and straws were burned into ash, and the ashes (which have alkaline properties) are mixed with water to form lather.	他们把稻壳和秸秆烧成灰烬，灰烬（具有碱性）与水混合就会形成泡沫。
The ashes and lather were scrubbed into the hair and rinsed out, leaving the hair clean, but very dry.	弄一些灰烬和泡沫到头发上，揉搓后用水冲洗掉，这样头发就干净了，但是非常干燥。
Afterwards, coconut oil was applied to the hair in order to moisturize it.	后来，椰子油也被用于洗头，以滋润头发。
Certain Native American tribes used extracts from North American plants as hair shampoo; for example the Costanoans of present-day coastal California used extracts from the coastal woodfern, Dryopteris expansa,	某些美洲土著部落以北美地区的植物提取物作为洗发液。例如，今天加利福尼亚沿海的柯斯达诺人就从沿海生长的木蕨（广布鳞毛蕨）中提取。

Pre-Columbian Andean civilizations used this soapy by-product as a shampoo.	前哥伦布时代的安第斯文明将这种含肥皂的副产品用作洗发水。
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates that shampoo containers accurately list ingredients on the products container.	美国食品药品监督管理局规定，在美国，洗发水必须在瓶身上准确列出所含成分。
The government further regulates what shampoo manufacturers can and cannot claim as any associated benefit.	政府还进一步规定了洗发水厂商可以宣称产品具有哪些功效，不可以宣称哪些功效。
Shampoo producers often use these regulations to challenge marketing claims made by competitors, helping to enforce these regulations.	洗发水生产商经常利用这些规定来挑战竞争对手的营销宣传，从而推动了这些规定的落实。
While the claims may be substantiated, however, the testing methods and details of such claims are not as straightforward.	然而，虽然对营销宣传进行验证是有其可能性的，但真要验起来，用什么手段，要验证哪些细节，谈何容易。
For example, many products are purported to protect hair from damage due to ultraviolet radiation.	比如，很多洗发用品都宣称能够保护头发免受紫外线辐射的伤害。
While the ingredient responsible for this protection does block UV, it is not often present in a high enough concentration to be effective.	洗发水中确实存在具有抵挡紫外线功能的成分，但浓度往往不够高，不足以有效地阻挡紫外线。
The North American Hair Research Society has a program to certify functional claims based on third-party testing.	北美头发研究协会就有一个基于第三方测试对功效宣传进行认证的计划。
Shampoos made for treating medical conditions such as dandruff or itchy scalp are regulated as OTC drugs in the US marketplace.	用于治疗头屑或头皮瘙痒等疾病状况的洗发水在美国市场被列为非处方药。

A number of contact allergens are used as ingredients in shampoos, and contact allergy caused by shampoos is well known.	一些接触性过敏原被用作洗发水的成分，由洗发水引起的接触性过敏是众所周知的。
Patch testing can identify ingredients to which patients are allergic, after which a physician can help the patient find a shampoo that is free of the ingredient to which they are allergic.	斑贴试验可以识别出患者对哪些成分过敏，然后医生就可以帮忙找到对该患者来说不含致敏成分的洗发水。
The US bans 11 ingredients from shampoos, Canada bans 587, and the EU bans 1328.	美国规定了 11 种洗发水禁用成分，加拿大 587 种，欧盟 1328 种。
Cosmetic companies have developed shampoos specifically for those who have dandruff.	化妆品公司研制了专门针对头皮屑患者的洗发水。
These contain fungicides such as ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione and selenium disulfide, which reduce loose dander by killing fungi like Malassezia furfur.	这些洗发水含有酮康唑、锌吡硫酮和硒二硫化物等杀菌剂，可以通过杀死糠秕马拉色菌之类的真菌来减少已经松动的头屑。
Coal tar and salicylate derivatives are often used as well.	煤焦油和水杨酸衍生品也常被用于其中。
Alternatives to medicated shampoos are available for people who wish to avoid synthetic fungicides.	想要避免使用合成杀菌剂的消费者可以选择药用洗发水。
Such shampoos often use tea tree oil, essential oils or herbal extracts.	这类洗发水的成分通常是茶树油、精油或草本提取物。
Many companies have also developed color-protection shampoos suitable for colored hair; some of these shampoos contain gentle cleansers according to their manufacturers.	很多公司还开发了适合染发者的护色洗发水，其中一些生产商表示自己的产品含有温和的清洁成分。
They have the advantage of being spill-proof.	这些洗发剂具有防溅的优点。
They are easy to apply; one may simply rub the bar over wet hair, and work the soaped hair into a low lather.	这种洗头皂易于使用：在打湿的头发上用皂块擦一下，将沾有皂液的头发揉出低泡沫。
Stiff, non-pourable clear gels to be squeezed from a tube were once popular forms of shampoo, and can be produced by increasing a shampoo's viscosity.	透明凝胶状的洗发水一度很流行，这种形式的洗发水很稠，倒不出来，要从管里挤出来用。这类洗发水可以通过增加洗发水的粘稠度来生产。
This type of shampoo cannot be spilled, but unlike a solid, it can still be lost down the drain by sliding off wet skin or hair.	这种洗发水不会溢出来，但与固体洗发剂不同的是，它还是会顺着打湿了的肌肤或头发滑下来落到排水沟中。
Shampoos in the form of pastes or creams were formerly marketed in jars or tubes.	膏状或霜状洗发剂之前是装在罐子或管子里出售的。
The contents were wet but not completely dissolved.	里面装的物质虽然是湿的，但未完全溶解。
They would apply faster than solids and dissolve quickly.	它用起来要比固态的快，溶解速度也很快。
Antibacterial shampoos are often used in veterinary medicine for various conditions, as well as in humans before some surgical procedures.	抗菌洗发剂经常用于应对兽医上的各种疾病状况，也用在进行外科手术之前的病人身上。
Closely associated with environmentalism, the "no poo" movement consists of people rejecting the societal norm of frequent shampoo use.	“no poo（不用洗头水）”运动与环保主义密切相关，参加该运动的人反对频繁使用洗发水洗头，对这一约定成俗的行为进行抵制。
Some adherents of the no poo movement use baking soda or vinegar to wash their hair, while others use diluted honey.	有些“no poo”倡导者改用小苏打或醋来洗头，有些用稀释的蜂蜜。
Other people use nothing, rinsing their hair only with conditioner.	还有些人什么洗发剂都不用，只用护发素冲一下头发。
In the 1970s, ads featuring Farrah Fawcett and Christie Brinkley asserted that it was unhealthy not to shampoo several times a week.	20 世纪 70 年代，由法拉·福西特和克里斯蒂·布林克利代言的一些广告称，一周不用几次洗发水会导致不健康。
This mindset is reinforced by the greasy feeling of the scalp after a day or two of not shampooing.	的确，一两天不用洗发水，就会觉得头皮油乎乎的，于是更加强化了人们的这种思维倾向。
Using shampoo every day removes sebum, the oil produced by the scalp.	每天用洗发水洗头可以去除皮脂，即头皮分泌出来的油脂。
This causes the sebaceous glands to produce oil at a higher rate, to compensate for what is lost during shampooing.	这会导致皮脂腺分泌油脂的速度加快，以弥补洗头过程中失去的油脂。
According to Michelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University, a gradual reduction in shampoo use will cause the sebum glands to produce at a slower rate, resulting in less grease in the scalp.	哥伦比亚大学的皮肤科医生米歇尔·汉贾尼表示，逐渐减少洗发水的使用可以使皮脂腺分泌油脂的速度减慢，这样就可以减少头皮上的油脂。
Although this approach might seem unappealing to some individuals, many people try alternate shampooing techniques like baking soda and vinegar in order to avoid ingredients used in many shampoos that make hair greasy over time.	虽然这一方法并不为一些人所待见，但很多人还是尝试着用其他方法来代替洗发水，如小苏打和醋等，因为洗发水中的成分时间一长就会致使头发变得油腻。
A railway platform is an area alongside a railway track providing convenient access to trains.	铁路站台是铁路轨道旁边的区域，以方便乘客登上列车。
Almost all stations have some form of platform, with larger stations having multiple platforms.	几乎所有的车站都设有某种形式的站台，较大的车站则会有多个站台。
The world's longest station platform is at Gorakhpur Junction in India at 1,355.40 metres (4,446.9 ft).	世界上最长的站台位于印度戈勒克布尔，长达1,355.40 米（4,446.9 英尺）。
The Appalachian Trail station in the United States, at the other extreme, has a platform which is only long enough for a single bench.	最短的站台位于美国阿巴拉契亚铁路站，长度仅够放一张长凳。
Among some United States train conductors the word "platform" has entered usage as a verb meaning "to berth at a station", as in the announcement: "The last two cars of this train will not platform at East Rockaway".	在美国的一些火车票售票员口中，“站台”一词已被用作动词，意为“在车站停靠”，比如像这样的播报：“本次列车最后两节车厢不停靠东罗卡威车站。”
The most basic form of platform consists of an area at the same level as the track, usually resulting in a fairly large height difference between the platform and the train floor.	站台最基本的形式是一块与铁轨高度持平的区域，这导致站台与车厢地板之间有一个很大的高度差。
This would often not be considered a true platform.	这样的站台通常不算真正意义上的站台。
The more traditional platform is elevated relative to the track but often lower than the train floor, although ideally they should be at the same level.	更典型的站台是高出铁轨的，但通常比车厢地板要低，尽管理想情况下站台应该和车厢地板一样高。
Occasionally the platform is higher than the train floor, where a train with a low floor serves a station built for trains with a high floor, for example at the Dutch stations of the DB Regionalbahn Westfalen (see Enschede).	有些情况下，站台会比车厢地板高，这种情况出现在地板较低的列车所经停的车站是为地板较高的列车而建的，比如德国联邦铁路北威州区域铁路停靠在荷兰火车站。
On the London Underground some stations are served by both District line and Piccadilly line trains, and the Piccadilly trains have lower floors.	伦敦地铁的一些地铁站经停区域线和皮卡迪利线两条线，其中皮卡迪利线就是车厢地板较低的。
A tram stop is often in the middle of the street; usually it has as a platform a refuge area of a similar height to that of the sidewalk (e.g. 100 mm (3.9 in)), and sometimes has no platform.	有轨电车车站一般位于街道中央，通常有一个作为站台的安全区，高度与人行道的高度（如 100 毫米（3.9 英寸）高）差不多。有些时候，有轨电车会不设站台。
The latter requires extra care by passengers and other traffic to avoid accidents.	没有站台则需要行人及来往车辆格外小心，以免发生事故。
Both types of tram stops can be seen in the tram networks of Melbourne and Toronto.	这两种类型的有轨电车停靠站，在墨尔本和多伦多的有轨电车网络中都可以看到。
Sometimes a tram stop is served by ordinary trams with rather low floors and metro-like light rail vehicles with higher floors, and the tram stop has a dual-height platform, as in Amstelveen, Netherlands.	有时，有轨电车停靠站会有地板很低的普通有轨电车以及地板较高类似地铁的轻轨经停，这时，有轨电车停靠站的站台就会有两种高度，如荷兰的阿姆斯特尔芬就是这种情况。
A train station may be served by heavy-rail and light-rail vehicles with lower floors and have a dual- height platform, as on the RijnGouweLijn in the Netherlands.	火车站可能会有车厢地板较低的重轨和轻轨两种列车经停，这种车站站台会设两种高度，如荷兰的 Rijn Gouwellijn 火车站。
Platform types include the bay platform, side platform (also called through platform), split platform and island platform.	站台类型包括港湾式站台、侧式站台（也叫岸式站台）、分离式站台以及岛式站台。
A bay platform is one at which the track terminates, i.e. a dead-end or siding.	港湾式站台是铁路终点站台，如铁路尽头或支线处。
Trains serving a bay platform must reverse in or out.	列车必须以进站（出站）时的颠倒方向驶出（驶入）港湾式站台。
A side platform is the more usual type, alongside tracks where the train arrives from one end and leaves towards the other.	侧式站台是更为常见的一种站台，位于轨道线路一侧，火车会从一端驶进，从另一端驶离。
An island platform has through platforms on both sides; it may be indented on one or both ends, with bay platforms.	岛式站台两边都有侧式站台，它可能会在一端或两端凹进去，形成港湾式站台。
To reach an island platform there may be a bridge, a tunnel, or a level crossing.	到达岛式站台可能要经过一个桥、隧道或平交道口。
A variant on the side platform is the spanish solution which has platforms on both sides of a single through track.	还有一种侧式站台是西班牙式站台，一条轨道两侧都有站台。
Some of the station facilities are often located on the platforms.	车站的一些设施通常设在站台上。
Where the platforms are not adjacent to a station building, often some form of shelter or waiting room is provided, and employee cabins may also be present.	如果站台不毗邻车站，站台上一般会设某种形式的遮阳棚或候车室，也可能设有工作人员管理室。
The weather protection offered varies greatly, from little more than a roof with open sides, to a closed room with heating or air-conditioning.	能遮风挡雨的设施种类很多，从单纯一个四面开放的棚顶，到配有暖气或空调的封闭空间。
There may be benches, lighting, ticket counters, drinking fountains, shops, trash boxes, and static timetables or dynamic displays with information about the next train.	可能会提供长凳、照明设备、售票柜台、饮水机、商店、垃圾箱、静态的列车时刻表以及下一趟列车的动态信息显示。
There are often loudspeakers as part of a public address (PA) system.	通常会有喇叭，作为公共广播（PA）系统的一部分。
The PA system is often used where dynamic timetables or electronic displays are not present.	在没有动态列车时刻表或电子显示设备时，往往就会用到公共广播系统。
A variety of information is presented, including destinations and times (for all trains, or only the more important long-distance trains), delays, cancellations, platform changes, changes in routes and destinations, the number of carriages in the train and the location of first class or luggage compartments, and supplementary fee or reservation requirements.	它可以提供各种各样的重要信息，包括目的地和时间（可能用于所有列车，也可能只用于比较重要的长途列车）、延误、取消、站台变更、路线和目的地变更、列车车厢数、头等车厢或行李箱所处的位置以及附加费用或预定要求等。
Some metro stations have platform screen doors between the platforms and the tracks.	一些地铁站会在站台与铁轨之间设置屏蔽门。
They provide more safety, and they allow the heating or air conditioning in the station to be separated from the ventilation in the tunnel, thus being more efficient and effective.	屏蔽门带来了更高的安全性，而且可以将车站内的暖气或冷气与隧道内的通风隔离开来，从而使车站耗能更少，效率更高。
They have been installed in most stations of the Singapore MRT and the Hong Kong MTR, and stations on the Jubilee Line Extension in London.	新加坡地铁和香港地铁的大部分站点以及伦敦地铁银禧延长线的站点都安装了这些屏蔽门。
Platforms should be sloped upwards slightly towards the platform edge to prevent wheeled objects such as trolleys, prams and wheelchairs from rolling away and into the path of the train.	为防止手推车、婴儿车、轮椅等带轮物体失控滑落到铁轨上，站台应该稍微朝站台边缘向上倾斜。
Many platforms have a cavity underneath an overhanging edge so that people who may fall off the platform can seek shelter from incoming trains.	很多站台在向外凸出的边缘下方设有一个洞，这样如果有人从站台失足掉下来，就可以躲过疾驰而来的地铁，捡回一命。
A dangerous practice is sitting on the edge of the platform, which requires withdrawing the legs fast enough when a train arrives.	坐在站台边缘是一种很危险的行为，因为这意味着列车进站时要以足够快的速度缩回双腿。
In high-speed rail, passing trains are a significant safety problem as the safe distance from the platform edge increases with the speed of the passing train.	在高速铁路中，随着列车运行速度的增大，与站台边缘的安全距离也随之增加，因此，列车的经过是一个重大的安全问题。
A study done by the United States Department of Transportation in 1999 found that trains passing station platforms at speeds of 240 kilometres per hour (150 mph) can pose safety concerns to passengers on the platforms who are 2 metres (6.6 ft) away from the edge due to the aerodynamic effects created by pressure and induced airflow with speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph) to 95 kilometres per hour (59 mph) depending on the train body aerodynamic designs.	美国运输部 1999 年的一项研究发现，列车以每小时 240 公里（150 英里）的速度经过车站站台时，会对站台上距离站台边缘 2 米（6.6 英尺）的乘客造成安全隐患，因为当时的压力和诱导气流速度达到每小时 64 公里（40 英里/小时）至每小时 95 公里（59 英里/小时），具体视列车车身的空气动力学设计而定，这种情况下会产生空气动力学效应。
Additionally, the airflow can cause debris to be blown out to the waiting passengers.	而且，在气流的作用下碎片会飞溅到正在候车的乘客身上。
If the passengers stand closer at 1 metre (3.3 ft), the risk increases with airflow that can reach speeds of 79 kilometres per hour (49 mph) to 116 kilometres per hour (72 mph).	如果乘客站得更近，比如离站台仅 1 米（3.3 英尺），则会更加危险，因为此时的气流速度可达每小时 79 千米（49 英里/小时）至 116 公里每小时（72 英里/小时）。
In United Kingdom, a guideline for platform safety specifies that for the platforms with train passing speeds between 160 kilometres per hour (99 mph) and 200 kilometres per hour (120 mph), there should be a yellow-line buffer zone of 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) and other warning signs.	在英国，一项关于站台安全的指南规定，对于列车通过速度在 160 公里/小时（99 英里/小时）到 200 公里/小时（120 英里/小时）之间的站台，应设置 1.5 米（4.9 英尺）黄色缓冲带和其他警告标志。
If trains can pass at speeds higher than 200 kilometres per hour (120 mph), the platforms should be inaccessible to passengers unless there are waiting rooms or screened areas to provide protection.	如果列车经过速度高于 200 公里/小时（120 英里/小时），应禁止乘客进入站台，除非站台设有可护乘客安全的候车室或屏蔽区。
The European Union has a regulation for platforms that are close to tracks with train passing speeds of 250 kilometres per hour (160 mph) or more should not be accessible to passengers unless there is a lower speed limit for trains that intend to stop at the station or there are barriers to limit access.	欧盟则规定，列车通过速度达 250 公里/小时（160 英里/小时）或更高时，靠近铁轨的站台不应向乘客开放，除非对拟停在本站的列车有限速规定，或设置了限制乘客进入的栅栏。
Platforms usually have some form of warnings or measures to keep passengers away from the tracks.	站台一般设有某种形式的警告或措施来让乘客远离铁轨。
The simplest measure is markings near the edge of the platform to demarcate the distance back that passengers should remain.	最简单的措施是在靠近站台边缘的地方做标记，划出乘客应该保持的距离。
Often a special tiled surface is used as well as a painted line, to help blind people using a walking aid, and help in preventing wheelchairs from rolling too near the platform edge.	除画线外，站台通常还铺设一个特殊的瓷砖表面，作为盲道帮助盲人通行，同时防止轮椅滑过时太靠近站台边缘。
In the US, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 regulations require a detectable warning strip 24 inches (61 cm) wide, consisting of truncated dome bumps in a visually-contrasting color, for the full length of the platform.	美国 1990 年颁行的《美国残疾人法案》规定，车站必须铺设一条长度与整个站台同长、宽 24 英寸（61 厘米）的易于发现的警示带，警示带必须带有扁圆点状凸起，颜色看起来要鲜明。
Ideally platforms should be straight or slightly convex, so that the guard can see the whole train when preparing to close the doors.	理想情况下，站台应该是直的或略微凸出的，这样列车长在准备关门的时候才能看见整个列车。
Platforms that have great curvature have blind spots that create a safety hazard.	曲度大的站台会造成视觉盲点，导致安全隐患。
Mirrors or closed-circuit cameras may be used in these cases to view the whole platform.	这种情况下，列车长可能会用镜子或闭路摄像头来查看整个站台。
Also passenger carriages are straight, so doors will not always open directly onto a curved platform – often a platform gap is present.	而且，由于车厢是直的，车门打开后无法与弯曲的站台很好地衔接，往往就会留下一条站台缝隙。
Usually such platforms will have warning signs, possibly auditory, such as London Underground's famous phrase "Mind the gap".	这样的站台通常会设警告信号，可能是以提示声的形式，比如伦敦地铁那句著名的“小心缝隙”。

Furthermore, sales of flip-flops exceeded those of sneakers for the first time in 2006.	2006 年，人字拖鞋的销量甚至首次超过了运动鞋的销量。
If these figures are accurate, it is remarkable considering the low cost of most flip-flops.	如果这些数据是准确的，考虑到大部分人字拖鞋的成本很低，这是个惊人的事实。
The modern flip-flop has a very simple design, consisting of a thin rubber sole with two straps running in a Y shape from the sides of the foot to the gap between the big toe and the one beside it.	现代人字拖鞋设计简约，包括薄的橡胶鞋底和两条 Y 型带子，带子从脚的两侧一直延伸至大脚趾和第二个脚趾之间。
They typically do not have a strap around the heel, although heeled varieties are available, as well as flip-flops designed for sports, which come with added support common to athletic shoes, with the thong between the toes.	虽然有高跟的版本，但通常跟部没有带子。此外也有专为运动设计的人字拖鞋，带有运动鞋常见的附加支撑以及脚趾处的人型带子。
Most modern flip-flops are inexpensive, costing as little as $5 USD, or less in some parts of the world.	大部分现代人字拖鞋价格便宜，只需 5 美元，在部分地区价格甚至更低。
They are made from a wide variety of materials, as were the ancient thong sandals.	与老式人字拖鞋一样，它们也由多种材料制成。

While flip-flops do provide the wearer with some mild protection from hazards on the ground, such as hot sand at the beach, glass, thumb tacks or even fungi and wart-causing viruses in locker rooms or community pools, their simple design is responsible for a host of other injuries of the foot and lower leg.	虽然人字拖鞋确实能为穿着者提供轻微防护，免受地面隐患危害，例如沙滩的热沙、玻璃、图钉，甚至还可以在更衣室或社区游泳池里避免感染真菌或导致疣的病毒，但其简单的设计可以回导致脚部和小腿遭受其它伤害。
Walking for long periods in flip-flops can be very tough on the feet, resulting in pain in the ankles, legs, and feet.	长时间穿着人字拖鞋走路对脚非常不好，可能会导致脚踝、腿部和脚部疼痛。
A 2009 study at Auburn University found that flip-flop wearers took shorter steps and their heels hit the ground with less vertical force than those wearing athletic shoes.	奥本大学 2009 年的研究发现，与运动鞋穿着者相比，人字拖鞋穿着者步伐更小，鞋跟碰地时垂直方向的力量更小。
Individuals with flat feet or other foot issues are advised to wear a shoe with better support.	患有扁平足或其他足部问题的个人建议穿支撑力更好的鞋子。
The lack of support provided by thong sandals is thought by some to be a major cause of injuries.	有的人认为由于人字拖鞋缺乏支撑力，更容易造成伤害。
Some flip-flops have a spongy sole, causing the foot to roll further inward than normal when it hits the ground (over-pronation).	有的人字拖鞋鞋底柔软，导致足部在落地时比平常更向内卷（足外翻）。
Flip-flops can cause a person to overuse the tendons in their feet, resulting in tendonitis.	人字拖鞋会导致足部肌腱使用过度，最终造成肌腱炎。
Ankle sprains or broken bones are also common injuries, due to stepping off a curb or tumbling; the ankle bends, but the flip-flop neither holds on to nor supports it.	由于走下路缘或摔倒，很容易造成脚踝扭伤或骨头断裂；脚踝弯曲时，人字拖鞋不跟脚或无法支撑它。
The straps of the flip-flop may cause frictional issues, such as rubbing, during walking.	走路时，人字拖鞋的带子可能会导致摩擦问题，例如磨脚。
The open-toed nature of the thongs may result in cuts, scrapes, bruises, or stubbed toes.	由于人字拖鞋无法包裹脚趾，可能会造成割伤、划伤、瘀伤或踢到脚趾。
Despite all of these issues, flip-flops do not have to be avoided completely.	尽管有这些问题存在，但没有必要完全避免穿着人字拖鞋。
Many podiatrists recommend avoiding the inexpensive, drug store varieties and spending more on sandals with thick-cushioned soles, as well as ones that have a strap that's not canvas and that comes back almost to the ankle.	许多足科医生建议避免在药妆店购买平价凉鞋，应该花多点钱购买有厚底的凉鞋以及带子材质不是帆布并且覆盖面接近脚踝的凉鞋。
A paper clip (or sometimes paperclip) is a device used to hold sheets of paper together, usually made of steel wire bent to a looped shape (though some are covered in plastic).	回形针是用来固定多张纸张的工具，通常用钢丝制成，弯成环形（有的表面会用塑料覆盖）。
Most paper clips are variations of the Gem type introduced in the 1890s or earlier, characterized by the almost two full loops made by the wire.	大多数回形针的原型都是 19 世纪 90 年代或更早出现的宝石型回形针，其特点是钢丝被弯成了两个几乎完整的圆形。
Common to paper clips proper is their utilization of torsion and elasticity in the wire, and friction between wire and paper.	回形针的原理是利用了钢丝的可弯曲性和弹性，以及钢丝和纸张之间的摩擦力。
When a moderate number of sheets are inserted between the two "tongues" of the clip, the tongues will be forced apart and cause torsion in the bend of the wire to grip the sheets together.	当在回形针两“舌”之间插入合适数量的纸张时，回形针的两舌会被分开，发生弯曲，并将纸张固定在一起。
Paper clips usually have an oblong shape with straight sides, but may also be triangular or circular, or have more elaborate shapes.	回形针的形状通常是有直边的椭圆形，但也可能是三角形或圆形，或是更复杂的形状。
The most common material is steel or some other metal, but moulded plastic is also used.	最常用的材料是钢或其他金属，但也会使用模压塑料。
Some other kinds of paper clip use a two-piece clamping system.	有些其他类型的回形针会使用两片夹紧的结构。
Recent innovations include multi-colored plastic-coated paper clips and spring-fastened binder clips.	最新的创新产品包括多彩涂塑回形针和弹簧装订夹。
According to the Early Office Museum, the first patent for a bent wire paper clip was awarded in the United States to Samuel B. Fay in 1867.	根据早期办公室博物馆，首个弯曲钢丝回形针的专利于 1867 年在美国颁给了塞缪尔·B·费伊。
This clip was originally intended primarily for attaching tickets to fabric, although the patent recognized that it could be used to attach papers together.	虽然专利认可回形针可以用来把纸张固定在一起，但这种回形针最早用于将标签固定在布料上。
Fay received U.S. patent 64,088 on April 23, 1867.	1867 年 4 月 23 日，费伊收到了美国专利 64,088 号。
Although functional and practical, Fay's design along with the 50 other designs patented prior to 1899 are not considered reminiscent of the modern paperclip design known today.	虽然这些设计很实用，但费伊的设计以及 1899 年以前取得专利的其他 50 种设计都不会让人联想起今天的现代回形针设计。
Another notable paper clip design was also patented in the United States by Erlman J. Wright in 1877.	另一种著名的回形针设计也是由艾尔曼·J·赖特于 1877 年在美国获得专利。
This clip was advertised at that time for use in fastening newspapers.	当时的广告宣传称这种回形针可用于固定报纸。
The most common type of wire paper clip still in use, the Gem paper clip, was never patented, but it was most likely in production in Britain in the early 1870s by "The Gem Manufacturing Company", according to the American expert on technological innovations, Professor Henry J. Petroski.	研究科技创新的美国专家亨利·J·彼得罗斯基教授表示，宝石型回形针是如今仍在使用的最常见的钢丝回形针类型，从未获得专利，但最可能是由“The Gem Manufacturing Company”于 19 世纪 70 年代在英国生产的。
He refers to an 1883 article about "Gem Paper-Fasteners", praising them for being "better than ordinary pins" for "binding together papers on the same subject, a bundle of letters, or pages of a manuscript".	他提到了 1883 年有关“宝石纸张固定器”的文章，赞扬它们在“同一个物体上固定纸张、固定一堆信件或多页手稿”时“比普通别针更好用”。
Since the 1883 article had no illustration of this early "Gem", it may have been different from modern paper clips of that name.	由于 1883 年的文章中没有附上早期“宝石”的图片，可能会与现代同名回形针有所不同。
The earliest illustration of its current form is in an 1893 advertisement for the "Gem Paper Clip".	它现在形态最早的图片出现在 1893 年“宝石回形针”的广告中。
In 1904 Cushman & Denison registered a trademark for the "Gem" name in connection with paper clips.	1904 年，Cushman & Denison 为回形针注册了“宝石”这个名字的商标。
The announcement stated that it had been used since March 1, 1892, which may have been the time of its introduction in the United States.	公告表示它自 1892 年 3 月 1 日开始使用，这可能是引入美国的时间。
Paper clips are still sometimes called "Gem clips", and in Swedish the word for any paper clip is "gem".	回形针有时仍被称为“宝石针”，瑞典语用“gem”表示所有类型的回形针。
Definite proof that the modern type of paper clip was well known in 1899 at the latest, is the patent granted to William Middlebrook of Waterbury, Connecticut on April 27 of that year for a "Machine for making wire paper clips." The drawing clearly shows that the product is a perfect clip of the Gem type.	现代回形针的确切证据可以追溯到最近的 1899 年。在那一年的 4 月 27 日，康涅狄格州沃特伯里的威廉·米德尔布鲁克因“制作钢丝回形针的机器”获得了专利。图片清晰显示了那个回形针恰好是宝石型的回形针。
The fact that Middlebrook did not mention it by name, suggests that it was already well known at the time.	米德尔布鲁克没有以自己的名字来命名，这说明当时它已经很出名了。
Since then countless variations on the same theme have been patented.	从那以后，同个物品的无数变体获得了专利。
Some have pointed instead of rounded ends, some have the end of one loop bent slightly to make it easier to insert sheets of paper, and some have wires with undulations or barbs to get a better grip.	有的是尖头的而不是圆头的；有的尾部的圆环会微微弯曲，更容易插入纸张；有的钢丝上有凸起或小勾，能起到更好的固定作用。
In addition, purely aesthetic variants have been patented, clips with triangular, star, or round shapes.	此外，纯美观的版本也获得了专利，例如三角形、星形或圆形的回形针。
But the original Gem type has for more than a hundred years proved to be the most practical, and consequently by far the most popular.	但是拥有一百年历史的原始宝石型是最实用的，因此也最受欢迎。
Its qualities—ease of use, gripping without tearing, and storing without tangling—have been difficult to improve upon.	它的品质（容易使用、固定却不会拉扯以及有序存放）已经达到最佳水平。
National Paperclip Day is May 29.	国际回形针日是 5 月 29 日。
It has been claimed, though apparently without evidence, that Herbert Spencer, the originator of the term "survival of the fittest", invented the paper clip.	虽然明显没有证据，但据称“适者生存”一词的创始人赫伯特·斯宾塞发明了回形针。
Spencer claimed in his autobiography to have invented a "binding-pin" that was distributed by Ackermann & Company, and he shows a drawing of the pin in his Appendix I (following Appendix H).	斯宾塞在自传中声称他发明了一种“装订别针”，由 Ackermann & Company 进行分销，他还在附录 I（以下附录 H）中展示了这种别针的图片。
This pin looked more like a modern cotter pin than a modern paper clip, but it was designed to hold sheets of paper together.	这种别针看起来更像今天的开口销，而不是今天的回形针，但它的确用于固定纸张。
It is approximately 15 cm unfolded.	它展开大约长 15 厘米。
A Norwegian, Johan Vaaler (1866–1910), has erroneously been identified as the inventor of the paper clip.	挪威人约翰·瓦勒（1866—1910）被错认为回形针的发明者。
He was granted patents in Germany and in the United States (1901) for a paper clip of similar design, but less functional and practical, because it lacked the last turn of the wire.	他的类似设计的回形针在德国和美国（1901）获得了专利，但这种回形针没那么实用，因为钢丝的最后部分没有弯曲。
Vaaler probably did not know that a better product was already on the market, although not yet in Norway.	瓦勒可能不知道市场上已经有更好的产品，虽然在挪威还未存在。
His version was never manufactured and never marketed, because the superior Gem was already available.	他的版本从未进行生产和市场营销，因为已经有更好的宝石版本。
Long after Vaaler's death his countrymen created a national myth based on the false assumption that the paper clip was invented by an unrecognised Norwegian genius.	在瓦勒逝世很长时间后，他的同胞编造了一个国家传说，错误地认为是一位得不到认可的挪威天才发明了回形针。
Norwegian dictionaries since the 1950s have mentioned Vaaler as the inventor of the paper clip, and that myth later found its way into international dictionaries and much of the international literature on paper clips.	自 20 世纪 50 年代起，挪威词典称瓦勒为回形针的发明者，随后国际词典和许多有关回形针的国际文学也收录了这个传说。
Vaaler probably succeeded in having his design patented abroad, despite the previous existence of more useful paper clips, because patent authorities at that time were quite liberal and rewarded any marginal modification of existing inventions.	虽然此前已有更实用的回形针，但瓦勒可能成功地在国外为他的设计获得了专利，因为当时的专利机构相当慷慨，会给现有发明的任何类似修改版本颁发专利。
Johan Vaaler began working for Alfred J. Bryns Patentkontor in Kristiania in 1892 and was later promoted to office manager, a position he held until his death.	1892 年，约翰·瓦勒开始在克里斯蒂安尼亚的 Alfred J. Bryns Patentkontor 工作，后来晋升为办公室经理，一直在这个职位上工作到逝世。
As the employee of a patent office, he could easily have obtained a patent in Norway.	作为专利办公室的员工，他很容易就在挪威获得了专利。
His reasons for applying abroad are not known; it is possible that he wanted to secure the commercial rights internationally.	无人知晓他在国外申请的原因；可能是因为他想确保在国际上拥有商事权。
Also, he may have been aware that a Norwegian manufacturer would find it difficult to introduce a new invention abroad, starting from the small home market.	此外，他可能也意识到挪威制造商很难从小的当地市场向国外引入新的发明。
Vaaler's patents expired quietly, while the "Gem" was used worldwide, including his own country.	瓦勒的专利悄无声息地过期了，而“宝石”却在全球范围广泛使用，包括他自己的国家。
The failure of his design was its impracticality.	他设计的失败之处在于不够实用。
Without the two full loops of the fully developed paper clip, it was difficult to insert sheets of paper into his clip.	由于它没有成熟回形针所拥有的两个完整环形，因此很难将其插入纸张中。
One could manipulate the end of the inner wire so that it could receive the sheet, but the outer wire was a dead end because it could not exploit the torsion principle.	人们可以操控内侧钢丝的尾部，使其能够卡在纸上，但外侧钢丝是个死胡同，因为其无法运用扭转原理。
The clip would instead stand out like a keel, perpendicular to the sheet of paper.	回形针会像船的龙骨一样突出，垂直于纸张。
The impracticality of Vaaler's design may easily be demonstrated by cutting off the last outer loop and one long side from a regular Gem clip.	从常规的宝石型回形针上切下最后的外侧环形以及一条长边，即可验证瓦勒设计的不实用性。
The originator of the Norwegian paper clip myth was an engineer of the Norwegian national patent agency who visited Germany in the 1920s to register Norwegian patents in that country.	挪威回形针传说的提出者是一名挪威国家专利局工程师，他在 20 世纪 20 年代到访德国，登记在德国注册的挪威专利。
He came across Vaaler's patent, but failed to detect that it was not the same as the then-common Gem-type clip.	他发现了瓦勒的专利，但没有认识到它并不是当时常见的宝石型回形针。
In the report of the first fifty years of the patent agency, he wrote an article in which he proclaimed Vaaler to be the inventor of the common paper clip.	他在专利局的前五十年报告中写了一篇文章，声称瓦勒发明了常见回形针。
This piece of information found its way into some Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II.	第二次世界大战后，一些挪威百科全书收录了这则信息。
Events of that war contributed greatly to the mythical status of the paper clip.	那场战争中的事件很大程度上造成了回形针的神秘状态。
Patriots wore them in their lapels as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi authorities when other signs of resistance, such as flag pins or pins showing the cipher of the exiled King Haakon VII of Norway were forbidden.	爱国者在翻领上佩戴它们，用来表示对德国占领者和当地纳粹机构的反抗，因为当时禁止使用其他反抗标志，如国旗徽章或表示被驱逐的挪威哈康七世的密码的徽章。
Those wearing them did not yet see them as national symbols, as the myth of their Norwegian origin was not commonly known at the time.	佩戴者没有认为它们是国家标志，因为当时挪威起源的传说不为人所知。
The clips were meant to denote solidarity and unity ("we are bound together").	回形针代表着团结统一（“我们紧密相连”）。
The wearing of paper clips was soon prohibited, and people wearing them could risk severe punishment.	很快就禁止佩戴回形针，佩戴者也可能会面临严厉处罚。
The leading Norwegian encyclopedia mentioned the role of the paper clip as a symbol of resistance in a supplementary volume in 1952, but did not yet proclaim it a Norwegian invention.	挪威领先百科全书曾在 1952 年的补充卷中提及回形针作为反抗的标志，但没有声称回形针是挪威发明。
That information was added in later editions.	后来的版本中添加了该信息。
According to the 1974 edition, the idea of using the paper clip to denote resistance originated in France.	根据 1974 年版，使用回形针表示反抗的想法起源于法国。
A clip worn on a lapel or front pocket could be seen as "deux gaules" (two posts or poles) and be interpreted as a reference to the leader of the French Resistance, General Charles de Gaulle.	在翻领或胸前口袋上佩戴回形针可以看作“两杠”的标志，可以指代法国抵抗运动的领导者夏尔·戴高乐将军。
The post-war years saw a widespread consolidation of the paper clip as a national symbol.	战后几年里，回形针被广泛认为是国家象征。
Authors of books and articles on the history of Norwegian technology eagerly seized it to make a thin story more substantial.	有关挪威科技史的书籍和文章的作者都渴望让这个小故事变得更有依据。
They chose to overlook the fact that Vaaler's clip was not the same as the fully developed Gem-type clip.	他们选择忽视瓦勒的回形针与成熟的宝石型回形针不一样这一事实。
In 1989 a giant paper clip, almost 7 m (23 ft) high, was erected on the campus of a commercial college near Oslo in honour of Vaaler, ninety years after his invention was patented. But this monument shows a Gem-type clip, not the one patented by Vaaler.	1989 年，发明获得专利的九十年后，为了纪念瓦勒，在奥斯陆附近的一所商学院的校园里建造了一座几乎 7 米（23 英尺）高的大型回形针雕塑。但这座雕塑是宝石型回形针，并不是瓦勒获得专利的那种。
The celebration of the alleged Norwegian origin of the paper clip culminated in 1999, one hundred years after Vaaler submitted his application for a German patent.	为回形针起源于挪威这一传说举办的庆祝活动于 1999 年达到高潮，距离瓦勒提交德国专利申请刚好一百年。
A commemorative stamp was issued that year, the first in a series to draw attention to Norwegian inventiveness.	那年发行了纪念邮票，这是首个引起人们重视挪威创造的系列。
The background shows a facsimile of the German "Patentschrift".	背景是德国“Patentschrift"的摹本。
However, the figure in the foreground is not the paper clip depicted on that document, but the much better known "Gem".	但前景中的形象并不是文件记载的回形针，而是更出名的“宝石”型回形针。
In 2005, the national biographical encyclopedia of Norway (Norsk biografisk leksikon) published the biography of Johan Vaaler, stating he was the inventor of the paper clip.	2005 年，挪威国家传记百科全书发表了约翰·瓦勒的传记，表示他发明了回形针。
Wire is versatile in its nature.	金属丝用途广泛。
Thus a paper clip is a useful accessory in many kinds of mechanical work including computer work: the metal wire can be unfolded with a little force.	因此，回形针在包括电脑运作等多种机械运作中都是实用配件：只需一点力就可以展开金属丝。
Several devices call for a very thin rod to push a recessed button which the user might only rarely need.	有的设备需要使用非常薄的杆按压嵌入式按钮，用户很少需要按压此按钮。
This is seen on most CD-ROM drives as an "emergency eject" should the power fail; also on early floppy disk drives (including the early Macintosh).	例如，大多数只读光盘驱动器上都有“紧急弹出”，避免突然断电；早期的软盘驱动器（包括早期的 Macintosh）上也有类似设置。
Various smartphones require the use of a long thin object such as a paper clip to eject the SIM card and some Palm PDAs advise the use of a paper clip to reset the device.	多种智能手机都需要使用回形针等薄的长形物体弹出 SIM 卡，有的 Palm PDA 也建议使用回形针重新设置设备。
The track ball can be removed from early Logitech pointing devices using a paper clip as the key to the bezel.	可以使用回形针作为外壳的钥匙从早期的罗技定点设备中移除追踪球。
A paper clip bent into a "U" can be used to start an ATX PSU without connecting it to a motherboard (connect the green to a black on the motherboard header).	将回形针弯成“U”型即可在无需连接至主板（将绿色连接至主板顶部的黑色）的情况下启动 ATX PSU。
One or more paper clips can make a loopback device for a RS232 interface (or indeed many interfaces).	使用一个或多个回形针即可为 RS232 接口（或其他多种接口）制作回环设备。
A paper clip could be installed in a Commodore 1541 disk-drive as a flexible head-stop.	可以在 Commodore 1541 软盘驱动器中安装回形针，用于随时停住磁头。
A paper clip can be used (unsafely) to temporarily bridge a blown fuse.	回形针可用于（不安全地）暂时接上烧断的保险丝。
The steel wire from a paperclip can be used in dentistry to form a dental post.	牙医可以使用回形针的钢丝来制作牙桩钉。
Paper clips can be bent into a crude but sometimes effective lock picking device.	回形针可以弯成粗糙但有时很有效的开锁设备。
Some types of handcuffs can be unfastened using paper clips.	有些类型的手铐可以用回形针打开。
There are two approaches.	有两种方式。
The first one is to unfold the clip in a line and then twist the end in a right angle, trying to imitate a key and using it to lift the lock fixator.	第一种是把回形针展开变成直线，然后将尾部扭成适当角度，尝试模仿钥匙并用其抬起锁固定器。
The second approach, which is more feasible but needs some practice, is to use the semi-unfolded clip kink for lifting when the clip is inserted through the hole where the handcuffs are closed.	第二种方法更加可行但需要练习，具体方法是把半展开的回形针插入锁好的手铐中抬起内部结构。
A paper clip image is the standard image for an attachment in an email client.	回形针图像是邮件附件中的标准图像。
In 1994, the US imposed anti-dumping tariffs against China, on paper clips.	1994 年，美国对中国的回形针强制收取反倾销关税。
The Band-Aid was invented in 1920 by a Johnson & Johnson employee, Earle Dickson in Highland Park, New Jersey for his wife Josephine, who frequently cut and burned herself while cooking.	1920 年，强生公司的一名员工厄尔·迪克森在新泽西州海兰帕克市发明了创可贴，缘由是妻子约瑟芬做饭时经常割伤和烫伤自己。
The prototype allowed her to dress her wounds without assistance.	这款最初的创可贴可以让她在没有人帮助的情况下包扎伤口。
Dickson passed the idea on to his employer, which went on to produce and market the product as the Band-Aid.	迪克森把这一思路带到公司，强生公司于是生产了这种产品并以“Band-Aid（创可贴）”的命名进行销售。
Dickson had a successful career at Johnson & Johnson, rising to vice president before his retirement in 1957.	迪克森在强生的事业很成功，1957 年退休前干到了副总裁的位置。
Perhaps a curiosity, the word "Band" in German means tape.	怕有人好奇，此处解释一下，“Band”在德语中是“绷带”的意思。
The original Band-Aids were handmade and not very popular.	最初的创可贴是手工制作的，买的人并不多。
By 1924, Johnson & Johnson introduced machine-made Band-Aids and began the sale of sterilized Band-Aids in 1939.	到 1924 年，强生公司开始推出机器制作的创可贴； 1939 年，强生开始销售消毒创可贴。
In 1951, the first decorative Band-Aids were introduced.	1951 年，第一款装饰创可贴面世。
They continue to be a commercial success, with such themes as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Oliver & Jenny, Superman, Spider-Man, Rocket Power, Rugrats, smiley faces, Barbie, Dora the Explorer, Batman and Duck Dynasty.	这一类创可贴也在市场上大获成功，有米奇老鼠、唐老鸭、奥利弗和珍妮、超人、蜘蛛侠、火箭动力、淘气小兵兵、笑脸、芭比娃娃、爱探险的朵拉、蝙蝠侠、鸭子王朝等主题。
In World War II, millions were shipped overseas, helping popularize the product.	二战期间，数以百万的创可贴被运到国外，帮助推广了这一产品。
Since then, Johnson & Johnson currently has estimated a sale of over 100 billion Band-Aids worldwide.	自那时起，强生迄今在全球销售的创可贴估计已经超过 1000 亿张。
Johnson & Johnson continues to defend the Band-Aid trademark against it being genericized.	强生公司一直维护 “Band-Aid”这个商标名，反对将其通用化。
Band-Aid arguably has, over time, become a genericized trademark in the United States, and a generic term cannot function as a trademark; but Johnson & Johnson has registered Band-Aid as a trademark on the Principal Register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and the registration is valid and legal.	随着时间的推移，“Band-Aid”可以说已经成为美国的通用商标，而通用名称是不能用作商标的。然而，强生公司已经在美国专利商标局的主薄注册了“Band-Aid”商标，注册是合法有效的。
A registration on the Principal Register does not create ownership rights under the laws of the United States, and a registration may be challenged and removed if the challenger proves as a matter of fact that the alleged trademark has become generic.	根据美国法律，在主薄上注册并不会产生所有权，如果有人提出要注销某注册商标，并在事实上证明其指称的商标已经成为通用商标，则该注册商标有可能会被注销。
To protect the name, their trademark, Johnson & Johnson always refers to its products as "BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages", not just "Band-Aid".	 为了维护这个品牌名，即他们的商标，强生一直以"BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages"指代这种产品， 而非仅仅叫"Band-Aid"。
The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on 17 December 1997.	1997 年 12 月 17 日，约恩·巴格尔创造了“网络博客”一词。
The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.	“博客”一词的创造者是彼得·默霍尔兹。1999 年 4 月或 5 月时，他开玩笑地将 weblog 一词拆分成短句“we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com”。
Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.	不久后，Pyra Labs 的埃文·威廉姆斯将“blog”一词作为名词和动词使用（“to blog”意思是“编辑某个人的博客或在某个人的博客上发帖”），并为 Pyra Labs' Blogger 产品设计了“博主”一词，该词迅速流行起来。
Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms including Usenet, commercial online services such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail lists, and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).	在博客流行起来之前，数字社区有多种形式，包括 Usenet、如 GEnie、Byte information Exchange (BIX) 和早期的CompuServe 等商业线上服务、邮件列表以及 Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)。
In the 1990s, Internet forum software created running conversations with "threads".	20 世纪 90 年代，互联网论坛软件使用“线程”创造出持续的对话。
Threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual "corkboard".	线程是虚拟“软木板”上消息之间的局部连接。
From 14 June 1993, Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their "What’s New" list of new websites, updated daily and archived monthly.	1993 年 6 月 14 日起，Mosaic Communications Corporation 每天都会更新新网站的“最新动态”列表，并且每月都会进行存档。
The page was accessible by a special "What's New" button in the Mosaic web browser.	可以点击 Mosaic 网页浏览器的“最新动态”特殊按钮进入该页面。
The earliest instance of a commercial blog was on the first business to consumer Web site created in 1995 by Ty, Inc., which featured a blog in a section called "Online Diary".	最早的商业博客是 Ty, Inc. 于 1995 年创建的首个企业对消费者网站，其中“线上日记”部分设有博客。
The entries were maintained by featured Beanie Babies that were voted for monthly by Web site visitors.	豆豆娃负责维护入口，每月由网站访客选出。
The modern blog evolved from the online diary where people would keep a running account of the events in their personal lives.	现代博客来源于人们持续记录个人生活中事件的线上日记。
Most such writers called themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers.	大部分这种作者都称呼自己为日记记录者。
Justin Hall, who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at Swarthmore College, is generally recognized as one of the earlier bloggers, as is Jerry Pournelle.	1994 年，贾斯汀·霍尔还是斯沃斯莫尔学院的学生时就开始记录个人博客，他被普遍公认为最早的博主之一，杰里·波内尔也是其中一位。
Dave Winer's Scripting News is also credited with being one of the older and longer running weblogs.	戴夫·温特尔的 Scripting News 也被认为是更早开始的网络博客之一。
The Australian Netguide magazine maintained the Daily Net News on their web site from 1996.	从 1996 年起，澳大利亚的 Netguide 杂志会在网站上保持更新每日网络新闻。
Daily Net News ran links and daily reviews of new websites, mostly in Australia.	每日网络新闻会记录新网站的链接和每日评论，这些网站大多数都在澳大利亚。
Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person's personal life combining text, digital video, and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994.	另一个早期博客是 1994 年的 Wearable Wireless Webcam，这是一个线上共享个人生活的日记，形式包括文字以及从可穿戴电脑和 EyeTap 设备实时上传的数字视频和数字照片。
This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters.	这种结合实时视频和文字的半自动化博客被称为穿戴式监视，这种日记也可作为法律问题中的证据使用。
Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a zine, before the term blog entered common usage.	在博客一词普遍使用之前，有些早期的博主，如 1997 年开始的 Misanthropic Bitch，称呼他们在网上发布的内容为电子杂志。
Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites.	早期的博客只是普通网站上手动更新的内容。
In 1995, the "Online Diary" on the Ty, Inc. Web site was produced and updated manually before any blogging programs were available.	1995 年，在博客程序出现以前，Ty, Inc. 网站创建了“线上日记”并进行手动更新。
Posts were made to appear in reverse chronological order by manually updating text based HTML code using FTP software in real time several times a day.	帖子按从新到旧的顺序显示，每天数次实时使用 FTP 软件手动更新 HTML 编码文本。
To users, this offered the appearance of a live diary that contained multiple new entries per day.	在用户看来，这像每天包含多条新纪录的实时日记。
At the beginning of each new day, new diary entries were manually coded into a new HTML file, and the start of each month, diary entries were archived into its own folder which contained a separate HTML page for every day of the month.	新的一天开始时，新的日记记录会被手动编码成新的 HTML 文件。每个月开始时，日记记录会存入包含一个月内每一天单独的 HTML 页面的文件夹中。
Then menus that contained links to the most recent diary entry were updated manually throughout the site.	然后，手动更新网站上包含最新日记记录链接的菜单。
This text-based method of organizing thousands of files served as a springboard to define future blogging styles that were captured by blogging software developed years later.	这种用文本整理数千份文件的方法为未来的博客提供了跳板，数年后会使用博客软件来管理博客。
The evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger and less technically-inclined population.	电子和软件工具的发展可以方便编写和维护按从新到旧顺序发表的网络文章，让更多对技术不太精通的人能够学会发表文章的过程。
Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today.	最终，这产生了独特的线上发表方式，由此出现今天我们认识的博客。
For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging".	例如，使用某些以浏览器为基础的软件就是如今典型的“发博客”。
Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services, on regular web hosting services, or run using blog software.	博客可以由专门的博客主机服务进行托管，在常规网络主机服务上托管，或通过博客软件运行。
An early milestone in the rise in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.	2002 年是博客重要性崛起的早期里程碑，当时许多博主非常关注美国参议院多数党领导人特伦特·洛特的言论。
Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president.	隶属纪念美国参议员斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德的党派的参议员洛特赞扬了参议员瑟蒙德，还表示如果以前瑟蒙德能当选总统，美国可能会比现在更好。
Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign.	洛特的批评家认为这些言论表示对种族隔离的赞同，种族隔离是瑟蒙德在 1948 年总统选举中提出的政策。
This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers.	这一观点在博主们挖掘的文件和采访录音中得到证实。
(See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.)	（详见约什·马歇尔谈话要点备忘录。）
Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story.	虽然洛特在众多媒体参加的公共活动中发表这些言论，但直到博主挖掘出这些事情后，媒体才对他的争议性言论进行大肆报道。
Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.	博客促发了一场政治危机，迫使洛特辞去多数党领导人一职。
Similarly, blogs were among the driving forces behind the "Rathergate" scandal.	同样，博客也是“拉瑟门”丑闻背后的推动力之一。
To wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather presented documents (on the CBS show 60 Minutes) that conflicted with accepted accounts of President Bush's military service record.	即：（电视记者）丹·拉瑟（在 CBS 的《60 分钟》节目中）展示的文件与公认的布什总统服役记录相矛盾。
Bloggers declared the documents to be forgeries and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view.	博主们声称文件是伪造的，并展示出支持该观点的证据和论据。
Consequently, CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see Little Green Footballs).	因此，CBS 为其所谓的报道技巧不足而道歉（详见 Little Green Footballs）。
Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a news source and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.	许多博主认为这次的丑闻揭开了媒体接受博客的序幕，博客不仅可以作为新闻的来源和建议，还可以作为施加政治压力的方式。
The impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination.	这些故事带来的影响让博客成为更可靠的新闻传播媒介。
Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead.	虽然博客常被视为党派八卦，但有时博主会首先公开关键信息，而主流媒体必须跟随他们的脚步。
More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media.	但新博客更常对主流媒体已发布的材料作出反应。
Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis.	同时，越来越多的专家成为博主，博客也因此成为深度分析的来源。
In Russia, some political bloggers have started to challenge the dominance of official, overwhelmingly pro-government media.	在俄罗斯，有的政治博主开始挑战官方亲政府媒体的领导地位。
Bloggers such as Rustem Adagamov and Alexei Navalny have many followers and the latter's nickname for the ruling United Russia party as the "party of crooks and thieves" has been adopted by anti-regime protesters.	Rustem Adagamov 和阿列克谢·纳瓦利内等博主有许多粉丝，后者还为执政的统一俄罗斯党起了一个别称叫“骗子和小偷的党派”，这个别称被反政府抗议者采用。
This led to the Wall Street Journal calling Navalny "the man Vladimir Putin fears most" in March 2012.	因此，2012 年 3 月，《华尔街日报》称纳瓦利内是“弗拉基米尔·普京最害怕的男人”。
By 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as political consultants, news services, and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming.	到 2004 年，博客逐渐占据主流地位，政治顾问、新服务和候选人都开始使用博客作为接触群众和形成观点的工具。
Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs' role as a news source.	政客和政治候选人都开设博客，发表对战争和其他议题的观点，加强了博客作为新闻来源的地位。
(See Howard Dean and Wesley Clark.) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the UK's Labour Party's MP Tom Watson, began to blog to bond with constituents.	（详见霍华德·迪安和韦斯利·克拉克。）甚至政客也没那么积极地举办选举活动，例如英国工党国会议员汤姆·沃森开始用博客与选民交流。
In January 2005, Fortune magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people "could not ignore": Peter Rojas, Xeni Jardin, Ben Trott, Mena Trott, Jonathan Schwartz, Jason Goldman, Robert Scoble, and Jason Calacanis.	2005 年 1 月，《财富》杂志列出了八位商界人士“无法忽视”的博主：彼得·罗哈斯、谢尼·雅尔丹、本·托罗特、梅娜·托罗特、乔纳森·施瓦茨、杰森·戈德曼、罗伯特·斯考伯和杰森·卡拉卡尼斯。
Israel was among the first national governments to set up an official blog.	以色列是首批设立官方博客的国家政府之一。

The Foreign Ministry also held a microblogging press conference via Twitter about its war with Hamas, with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference.	外交部还通过推特就与哈马斯的战争举办了微博客新闻发布会，萨兰加在全球直播的新闻发布会上用常见的缩写文本回答了公众的问题。
The questions and answers were later posted on IsraelPolitik, the country's official political blog.	随后在国家官方政治博客 IsraelPolitik 上发布了问题和回答。
The impact of blogging upon the mainstream media has also been acknowledged by governments.	博客对主流媒体的影响也得到了政府的认可。
In 2009, the presence of the American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy, resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area.	2009 年，随着多家报纸公司申请破产，美国新闻业的主导地位逐渐下降，导致同一发行领域的报纸之间的直接竞争减少。
Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government.	人们开始讨论联邦政府的刺激政策是否对报纸业有益处。
U.S. President Barack Obama acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying "if the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context, then what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding”.	美国总统贝拉克·奥巴马承认博客对社会日益增长的影响力，他表示“如果新闻的发展方向只是博客空间，只是各种意见，不经过严格的事实查证，不严肃地讲出前因后果，最终只会变成人们互相大喊，而无法互相理解”。
Between 2009 and 2012, an Orwell Prize for blogging was awarded.	2009 年至 2012 年都为博客颁发了奥威尔奖。
Many bloggers, particularly those engaged in participatory journalism, are amateur journalists, and thus they differentiate themselves from the professional reporters and editors who work in mainstream media organizations.	许多博主，特别是参与式新闻博主，都是业余记者，因此他们把自己与在主流媒体工作的专业记者和编辑区分开来。
Other bloggers are media professionals who are publishing online, rather than via a TV station or newspaper, either as an add-on to a traditional media presence (e.g., hosting a radio show or writing a column in a paper newspaper), or as their sole journalistic output.	其他博主是媒体专业人士，他们在网上发布，而不是在电视或报纸上发布内容，这可能是他们对传统媒体（如主持电台节目或在纸质报纸上写专栏）的补充，或是他们唯一输出新闻的地方。
Some institutions and organizations see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" of media "gatekeepers" and pushing their messages directly to the public.	有的机构和组织把博客视为“绕开”媒体“守门员”的方式，可以直接向公众推送信息。
Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs—well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list.	同时，许多主流记者都会写自己的博客，根据 CyberJournalist.net 的记者博客名单，数量超过 300 个。
The first known use of a blog on a news site was in August 1998, when Jonathan Dube of The Charlotte Observer published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.	1998 年 8 月，首次在新闻网站上使用博客，当时《夏洛特观察家》的乔纳森·杜比发表了飓风邦尼记录。
Some bloggers have moved over to other media.	有的博主转移到其他媒体。
The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: Duncan Black (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit), Markos Moulitsas Zúniga (Daily Kos), Alex Steffen (Worldchanging), Ana Marie Cox (Wonkette), Nate Silver (FiveThirtyEight.com), and Ezra Klein (Ezra Klein blog in The American Prospect, now in the Washington Post).	以下（及其他）博主出现在电台和电视上：邓肯·布莱克（以笔名阿特里奥斯闻名）、格伦·雷诺兹（Instapundit）、Markos Moulitsas Zúniga（Daily Kos）、亚历克斯·斯特芬（Worldchanging）、安娜·玛丽·考克斯（Wonkette）、纳特·西尔弗（FiveThirtyEight.com）以及 以斯拉·凯恩（以斯拉·凯恩的博客原本在《美国展望》，现在《华盛顿邮报》）。
In counterpoint, Hugh Hewitt exemplifies a mass media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger.	相反，休·休伊特是大众传媒人物代表，他转向另一个方向，通过成为具有影响力的博主，扩大自己在“旧媒体”的影响力。
Similarly, it was Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online blog articles that captured Surgeon General of the United States Richard Carmona's attention and earned his kudos for the associated broadcasts by talk show host Lisa Tolliver and Westchester Emergency Volunteer Reserves-Medical Reserve Corps Director Marianne Partridge.	同样地，正是《应急准备》和《在线广播安全建议》等博客文章引起了美国卫生局局长理查德·卡莫纳的注意，并因脱口秀主持人丽莎·托利佛和韦斯特切斯特应急志愿者储备的医疗储备小组组长玛丽安·帕特里奇的相关广播而赢得称赞。
Blogs have also had an influence on minority languages, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in Gaelic languages.	博客也影响了小语种，把分散的讲和学这些语言的人聚集起来；盖尔语博客就是一个突出的例子。
Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.	小语种出版业（缺乏经济可行性）可以通过成本低的博客找到其受众。
There are examples of bloggers who have published books based on their blogs, e.g., Salam Pax, Ellen Simonetti, Jessica Cutler, ScrappleFace.	以下博主都根据他们的博客出版了书籍，例如萨拉姆·帕克斯、艾伦·西蒙尼第、杰西卡·卡特勒、ScrappleFace。

The book based on Julie Powell's blog "The Julie/Julia Project" was made into the film Julie & Julia, apparently the first to do so.	以朱莉·鲍威尔的博客“朱莉/朱莉亚项目”为基础的书籍被翻拍成电影《朱莉与朱莉亚》，这是第一本被翻拍的博客书。
Consumer-generated advertising is a relatively new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers.	由消费者驱动的广告是相对有争议的新发展，为从企业到消费者的市场营销沟通创造了新的模式。
Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts.	在各种博客广告模式中，最具争议性的就是赞助帖。
These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords.	这些博客记录或帖子可能是反馈、评价、意见、视频等形式，通常用一个或多个关键词设置可跳转特定网站的链接。
Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites.	博客带来了一定程度的去中介化，影响了传统广告模式，企业可以跳过广告公司（此前是与消费者交流的唯一途径），通过社交媒体网站直接联系消费者。
On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, to take advantage of this new development as well.	另一方面，为了利用这项新发展，也建立了专门制作博客广告的新公司。
However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development.	但是，还有很多人不看好这项新发展。
Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.	有的人认为博客上任何形式的贸易活动都会破坏博客圈的公信力。
Blogging can result in a range of legal liabilities and other unforeseen consequences.	博客可能会导致一系列的法律责任和其他无法预测的后果。
Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers concerning issues of defamation or liability.	已经有几起针对博主的案件被提交至国家法院，案件涉及诽谤或责任问题。

In Doe v. Cahill, the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration.	在多伊起诉卡希尔的案件中，特拉华州最高法院认为揭露匿名博主身份时必须要遵守严格的标准，还采取了非同寻常的措施，驳回诽谤案件（根据美国诽谤法，这是没有根据的），而不是将其发回初审法庭重新审议。
In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival.	奇怪的是，卡希尔夫妇获得了约翰·多伊的身份，结果发现正是他们怀疑的人。多伊是该镇的镇长，也是议员卡希尔的政治对手。
The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial.	卡希尔夫妇修改了原来的起诉书，镇长处理了案件，无需提交法院审判。
In January 2007, two prominent Malaysian political bloggers, Jeff Ooi and Ahirudin Attan, were sued by a pro-government newspaper, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan, Hishamuddin bin Aun and Brenden John a/l John Pereira over an alleged defamation.	2007 年 1 月，两名马来西亚著名政治博主黄泉安和阿希鲁丁·阿丹因涉嫌诽谤被亲政府报纸新海峡时报（马来西亚）有限公司、Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan、Hishamuddin bin Aun 和 Brenden John a/l John Pereira 起诉。

In the United States, blogger Aaron Wall was sued by Traffic Power for defamation and publication of trade secrets in 2005.	在美国，博主亚伦·沃尔于 2005 年因诽谤和泄露商业机密被 Traffic Power 起诉。
According to Wired magazine, Traffic Power had been "banned from Google for allegedly rigging search engine results." Wall and other "white hat" search engine optimization consultants had exposed Traffic Power in what they claim was an effort to protect the public.	据《连线》杂志报道，Traffic Power“因涉嫌操纵搜索引擎结果而被谷歌禁止”。沃尔和其他“白帽”搜索引擎优化顾问曾曝光 Traffic Power 声称是在努力保护公众。
The case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Traffic Power failed to appeal within the allowed time.	由于缺乏属人管辖权，该案件被驳回，Traffic Power 未能在规定时间内上诉。
The word "pineapple" in English was first recorded to describe the reproductive organs of conifer trees (now termed pine cones).	英语中“菠萝”一词最早被用来形容针叶树的生殖器官（现在称为松果）。

In the wild, pineapples are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds.	在野外，菠萝主要由蜂鸟授粉。
Certain wild pineapples are foraged and pollinated at night by bats.	蝙蝠会在夜晚食用部分野生菠萝并进行授粉。
Under cultivation, because seed development diminishes fruit quality, pollination is performed by hand, and seeds are retained only for breeding.	在栽培过程中，由于种子发育会降低果实的质量，因此采用人工授粉，种子只用于育种。
Specifically in Hawaii, where pineapples were cultivated and canned industrially throughout the 20th century, importation of hummingbirds was prohibited.	特别是在整个 20 世纪都在种植菠萝和进行工业化装罐的夏威夷，禁止进口蜂鸟。
The plant is indigenous to South America and is said to originate from the area between southern Brazil and Paraguay; however, little is known about the origin of the domesticated pineapple (Pickersgill, 1976).	这种植物原产于南美，据说起源于巴西南部和巴拉圭之间的地区；但是，人们对家种菠萝的起源知之甚少。（皮克斯格尔，1976）
MS Bertoni (1919) considered the Paraná–Paraguay River drainages to be the place of origin of A. comosus.	MS Bertoni（1919）认为巴拉那-巴拉圭河流是菠萝的原产地。

Because of the expense of direct import and the enormous cost in equipment and labour required to grow them in a temperate climate, using hothouses called "pineries", pineapples soon became a symbol of wealth.	由于直接进口价格昂贵，保持适宜种植的温度所需设备和劳动力成本高，要使用名为“菠萝园”的温室，因此菠萝很快就成为了财富的象征。
They were initially used mainly for display at dinner parties, rather than being eaten, and were used again and again until they began to rot.	它们最开始不是用作食物，而是主要用于在晚餐派对上作展示品，然后重复使用直到开始腐烂。
By the second half of the 18th century, the production of the fruit on British estates had become the subject of great rivalry between wealthy aristocrats.	到了 18 世纪下半叶，在英国庄园生产这种水果已经成为富有的贵族之间的竞争主题。

They were favored for their light and breezy quality, which was ideal in the hot tropical climate of the islands.	它们因轻便透气受到欢迎，非常适合岛屿上的热带炎热气候。
The industry was destroyed in the Second World War and is only starting to be revived.	该产业在第二次世界大战中被破坏，刚刚开始恢复。
In 2017, world production of pineapples was 27.4 million tons, led by Costa Rica, the Philippines, Brazil, and Thailand as the largest producers.	2017 年，全球菠萝产量为 2740 万吨，最大的生产国是哥斯达黎加、菲律宾、巴西和泰国。
In commercial farming, flowering can be induced artificially, and the early harvesting of the main fruit can encourage the development of a second crop of smaller fruits.	在商业种植中，可以人工诱导开花，而且收获早期的主要果实可以促进第二波较小果实的生长。
Once removed during cleaning, the top of the pineapple can be planted in soil and a new plant will grow.	清洁时去掉菠萝头后，可以把菠萝头种在土里，就会长出新的植物。
Three-quarters of the pineapples sold in Europe are grown in Costa Rica, where pineapple production is highly industrialised.	欧洲售卖的菠萝中有四分之三都产自哥斯达黎加，这里的菠萝生产已高度工业化。
Growers typically use 20 kg (44 lb) of pesticides per hectare in each growing cycle, a process that may affect soil quality and biodiversity.	种植者通常在每个生长周期会使用每公顷 20 千克（44 磅）农药，这个过程可能会影响土壤质量和生物多样性。
The pesticides—organophosphates, organochlorines, and hormone disruptors—have the potential to affect workers' health and can contaminate local drinking water supplies.	有机磷、有机氯和激素干扰物等农药可能会影响工人的健康以及污染当地饮水供应。
Many of these chemicals have potential to be carcinogens, and may be related to birth defects.	许多化学物质都可能是致癌物质，还可能会导致先天性缺陷。

Present in all parts of the pineapple plant, bromelain is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes.	菠萝蛋白酶存在于菠萝植物的各个部位，是一种蛋白水解酶的混合物。
Bromelain is under preliminary research for a variety of clinical disorders, but to date has not been adequately defined for its effects in the human body.	现正针对多种临床疾病对菠萝蛋白酶进行初步研究，但迄今为止尚未充分确定它对人体的效果。
Bromelain may be unsafe for some users, such as in pregnancy, allergies, or anticoagulation therapy.	菠萝蛋白酶对部分用户而言可能不安全，例如孕妇、过敏患者或接受抗凝治疗的患者。
If having sufficient bromelain content, raw pineapple juice may be useful as a meat marinade and tenderizer.	如果生菠萝汁有足够的菠萝蛋白酶，可能与腌肉料和嫩肉剂有同样效果。
Although pineapple enzymes can interfere with the preparation of some foods or manufactured products, such as gelatin-based desserts or gel capsules, their proteolytic activity responsible for such properties may be degraded during cooking and canning.	虽然菠萝酶会影响某些食物或工业产品的制备，例如用明胶制作的甜点或凝胶胶囊，但是这种特性的蛋白水解活动可能会在烹饪和装罐期间得到减轻。
The quantity of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, but specific extraction can yield sufficient quantities for domestic and industrial processing.	特定份量的菠萝果实可能不会含有大量菠萝蛋白酶，但在家庭和工业加工时可以使用某些提取方法获得足够份量的菠萝蛋白酶。
Pineapples are subject to a variety of diseases, the most serious of which is wilt disease vectored by mealybugs typically found on the surface of pineapples, but possibly in the closed blossom cups.	菠萝容易感染多种疾病，其中最严重的是由粉蚧传播的枯萎病，粉蚧通常存在于菠萝的表面，但也有可能存在于封闭的花杯中。

Heart-rot is the most serious disease affecting pineapple plants.	心腐病是影响菠萝植物最严重的疾病。
The disease is caused by Phytophthora cinnamoni and P. parasitica, fungi that often affect pineapples grown in wet conditions.	该疾病由樟疫霉和寄生疫霉引起，这两种真菌通常会影响生长在潮湿环境的菠萝。
Since it is difficult to treat, it is advisable to guard against infection by planting resistant cultivars where these are available; all suckers that are required for propagation should be dipped in a fungicide, since the fungus enters through the wounds.	由于疾病难以治疗，因此建议在有条件的地方种植抗病品种来避免感染；所有繁殖所需的根出条都应浸泡杀真菌剂，因为真菌会通过伤口进入。
Some buyers prefer green fruit, others ripened or off-green.	有的买手喜欢绿色的果实，而其他买手喜欢成熟或者不绿的果实。
A plant growth regulator, Ethephon, is typically sprayed onto the fruit one week before harvest, developing ethylene, which turns the fruit golden yellow.	通常会在收获前一周时往果实上喷洒植物生长调节剂乙烯利，乙烯利能够使果实变成金黄色。
After cleaning and slicing, a pineapple is typically canned in sugar syrup with added preservative.	清洁和切片后，菠萝通常会与糖浆和防腐剂一起装罐。
A pineapple never becomes any riper than it was when harvested.	菠萝会一直保持收获时的成熟状态。
The fruit itself is quite perishable and if it is stored at room temperature, it should be used within two days; however, if it is refrigerated, the time span extends to 5–7 days.	水果本身容易腐烂，如果存放在室温条件下，应该在两天内食用完毕；但是如果存放在冰箱内，保质期可延长至 5—7 天。
Mimi Sheller writes: "The pineapple entered European iconography as a symbol of welcome and hospitality, and also eventually found its way into botanical gardens such as the Chelsea Physic Garden, where it was grown in heated pits." The sweet fruit had a "mysterious aura" in the Age of Sail because except for a "small elite with access to glass hothouses", tropical fruits could only be tasted where they were cultivated.	米米·雪勒写到：“欧洲人最初认为菠萝象征着热情好客，菠萝最终还被种在切尔西草药园等植物园的温室中。”这种甜甜的水果在航海时代有“神秘的光环”，因为除了“少数拥有玻璃温室的贵族外”，只有在当地才能品尝到热带水果。
Christopher Cumo writes that "The Spanish who followed Columbus delighted in eating pineapple and in writing about it for a European public eager to learn of the flora and fauna of the Americas ...	克里斯托弗·库莫写道：“那些跟随着哥伦布的西班牙人喜欢吃菠萝和为欧洲公众描写与菠萝有关的信息。他们渴望了解美洲的动植物……
The pineapple was first a luxury because transit from the tropics to Europe was expensive in the age of sail.	菠萝最初是奢侈品，因为在航海时代把菠萝从热带送到欧洲的成本非常昂贵。
In this respect, pineapple was much like sugar, a commodity of privilege before it became an item of the masses." Cumo writes that "pineapple was the fruit of colonialism" because the Portuguese, French, Dutch, and British all sought to establish pineapple plantations in the tropics of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean.	因此，在菠萝成为大众商品前，它就像糖一样，是贵族商品。”库莫写道，“菠萝是殖民主义的水果”，因为葡萄牙人、法国人、荷兰人和英国人都试图在南美、中美和加勒比海的热带地区建造菠萝种植园。
In architecture, pineapple figures are a decorative element symbolizing hospitality.	在建筑领域，菠萝是一种象征热情好客的装饰元素。
Usually in plaster or carved wood, pineapples images occur in finials, pendants,"broken" pediments, and door knockers.	菠萝装饰的材质通常是塑料或雕木，出现在尖顶饰、吊坠、“破”山形墙饰和门环上。
Pineapples have long been associated with the Hawaiian Islands, to the extent that the pineapple is sometimes used as a symbol of Hawaii, despite the decline of the pineapple industry in that state.	人们一直都把菠萝与夏威夷岛关联起来，即使夏威夷的菠萝产业已经没落，菠萝有时仍被视为夏威夷的标志。
Foods with pineapple in them are sometimes known as "Hawaiian" for this reason alone.	仅仅出于这个原因，用菠萝制作的食物有时会被冠上“夏威夷”的名字。
A roller coaster is a type of amusement ride that employs a form of elevated railroad track designed with tight turns, steep slopes, and sometimes inversions.	过山车是一种采用高架铁轨形式的游乐设施，设计有急转弯、陡坡，有时还有翻转。
People ride along the track in open cars, and the rides are often found in amusement parks and theme parks around the world.	人们坐在敞篷车厢里乘坐过山车，全球各地的游乐场和主题公园通常都有过山车。
LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained one of the first known patents for a roller coaster design in 1885, related to the Switchback Railway that opened a year earlier at Coney Island.	拉马库斯·阿德纳·汤普森于 1885 年获得了最早一批的过山车专利，该专利涉及一年前在科尼岛开幕的 Switchback Railway 过山车。
The track in a coaster design does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate.	像穿梭过山车一样，过山车的轨道不一定是一个完整的回圈。
Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained.	大多数过山车都有多节车厢，乘客会绑好安全带坐在里面。
Two or more cars hooked together are called a train.	两节或以上的车厢连接在一起被称为列车。
Some roller coasters, notably Wild Mouse roller coasters, run with single cars.	部分过山车（如野鼠过山车）以单节车厢运行。
The oldest roller coasters are believed to have originated from the so-called "Russian Mountains", specially constructed hills of ice located in the area that is now Saint Petersburg, Russia.	据说最古老的过山车起源于所谓的“俄罗斯山”，这是一种特别建造的冰山，位于今俄罗斯圣彼得堡。
Built in the 17th century, the slides were built to a height of between 21 and 24 m (70 and 80 feet), had a 50-degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports.	这座山建于 17 世纪，高度介于 21 到 24 米（70 到 80 英尺）之间，倾斜度为 50 度，有木质结构支撑。
Later, in 1784, Catherine the Great is said to have constructed a sledding hill in the gardens of her palace at Oranienbaum in St. Petersburg.	后来，据说在 1784 年，叶卡捷琳娜二世在位于圣彼得堡的奥拉宁鲍姆宫建造了一座雪橇山。
The name Russian Mountains to designate a roller coaster is preserved in many languages (e.g. the Spanish montaña rusa), but the Russian term for roller coasters is американские горки ("amerikanskiye gorki"), which translates to "American mountains."	许多语言仍使用俄罗斯山指代过山车（如西班牙语的 montaña rusa），但过山车在俄语中是 американские горки（“amerikanskiye gorki”），意思是“美国山”。
The first modern roller coaster, the Promenades Aeriennes, opened in Parc Beaujon in Paris on July 8, 1817.	第一座现代过山车名为 Promenades Aeriennes，于 1817 年 7 月 8 日在巴黎的 Parc Beaujon 开幕。
It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds.	其特点是车厢的轮子会牢牢地卡在轨道上，导轨会确保列车在正确轨道上运行，而且速度更快。
It spawned half a dozen imitators, but their popularity soon declined.	它引来了六个模仿者，但很快就不流行了。
However, during the Belle Epoque they returned to fashion.	但在美好年代时期又流行起来。
In 1887 French entrepreneur Joseph Oller, co-founder of the Moulin Rouge music hall, constructed the Montagnes Russes de Belleville, "Russian Mountains of Belleville" with 656 feet (200 m) of track laid out in a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.	1887 年，法国企业家、红磨坊音乐厅联合创始人约瑟夫·奥勒建造了 Montagnes Russes de Belleville（“贝尔维尔俄罗斯山”），轨道总长 656 英尺（200 米），以双 8 形铺设，然后扩大成四个 8 形圆环。
In 1827, a mining company in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania constructed the Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway, a downhill gravity railroad used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania – now known as Jim Thorpe.	1827 年，位于宾夕法尼亚州萨米特希尔的一家矿业公司建造了 Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway 铁路，这是一条下坡重力铁路，用于把煤运往宾夕法尼亚州 Mauch Chunk（今吉姆索普）。
By the 1850s, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers.	到 19 世纪 50 年代，人们熟知的“重力之路”开始向寻求刺激的人提供游乐设施。
Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.	铁路公司在乘坐人数较少的时候用类似的铁路提供娱乐。
Using this idea as a basis, LaMarcus Adna Thompson began work on a gravity Switchback Railway that opened at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, in 1884. Passengers climbed to the top of a platform and rode a bench-like car down the 600-foot (183 m) track up to the top of another tower where the vehicle was switched to a return track and the passengers took the return trip.	以这个想法为基础，拉马库斯·阿德纳·汤普森开始建造一座重力 Switchback Railway，并于 1884 年在纽约布鲁克林的科尼岛开幕。乘客要爬到平台的顶部，然后乘坐长椅状的列车，从高 600 英尺（183 米）的轨道上滑下来，然后再滑到另一座塔的顶端，列车会在那里切换至返回轨道，乘客们就开始回程。
This track design was soon replaced with an oval complete circuit.	这个轨道设计很快就被替换成椭圆形的完整回圈。
In 1885, Phillip Hinkle introduced the first full-circuit coaster with a lift hill, the Gravity Pleasure Road, which became the most popular attraction at Coney Island.	1885 年，菲利普·欣克尔推出了首座带爬升坡的全回圈过山车，名为 Gravity Pleasure Road，成为科尼岛最受欢迎的游乐设施。
Not to be outdone, in 1886 Thompson patented his design of roller coaster that included dark tunnels with painted scenery.	1886 年，汤普森也不甘落后，他设计的包含绘制风景暗道的过山车获得了专利。

Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, Cyclone, was opened at Coney Island in 1927.	旋风过山车可能是历史上最出名的过山车，于 1927 年在科尼岛开幕。
The Great Depression marked the end of the golden age of roller coasters, and theme parks, in general, went into decline.	大萧条终结了过山车的黄金时代，大部分主题公园开始没落。
This lasted until 1972 when the instant success of The Racer at Kings Island began a roller coaster renaissance which has continued to this day.	这种情况持续到 1972 年，国王岛游乐园的赛车过山车突然获得成功，自此开启了过山车复兴，一直延续至今。
In 1959, Disneyland introduced a design breakthrough with Matterhorn Bobsleds, the first roller coaster to use a tubular steel track.	1959 年，迪士尼乐园推出了有突破性设计的 Matterhorn Bobsleds，这是首座使用管状钢轨的过山车。
Unlike wooden coaster rails, tubular steel can be bent in any direction, allowing designers to incorporate loops, corkscrews, and many other maneuvers into their designs.	与木质过山车轨道不同，管状钢轨可以弯成任何角度，设计师就可以更好地在设计中结合圆环、急转以及其他操作。
Most modern roller coasters are made of steel, although wooden coasters and hybrids are still being built.	大多数现代过山车都是用钢铁制成，但仍有木质过山车和混合过山车。
There are several explanations of the name roller coaster.	过山车这个名字有多种解释。
It is said to have originated from an early American design where slides or ramps were fitted with rollers over which a sled would coast.	据说起源于早期美国设计，这种设计的滑坡或斜坡上装有可以让列车滑行的滚轮。
This design was abandoned in favor of fitting the wheels to the sled or other vehicles, but the name endured.	由于轮子被安装到雪橇或其他车辆上，因此这种设计被放弃了，但名字却被保留下来。
Another explanation is that it originated from a ride located in a roller skating rink in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1887.	另一种解释是，它起源于 1887 年位于马萨诸塞州黑弗里尔一座轮滑场的游乐设施。
A toboggan-like sled was raised to the top of a track which consisted of hundreds of rollers.	类似于平底雪橇的小车被抬到轨道顶部，轨道包含数百个滚轮。
This Roller Toboggan then took off down gently rolling hills to the floor.	然后，Roller Toboggan 缓慢从山上滑下。
The inventors of this ride, Stephen E. Jackman and Byron B. Floyd, claim that they were the first to use the term "roller coaster".	过山车的发明者史蒂芬·E·杰克曼和拜伦·B·弗洛伊德声称他们是第一个使用“过山车”一词的人。
The term jet coaster is used for roller coasters in Japan, where such amusement park rides are very popular.	在过山车很流行的日本，人们用云霄飞车一词指代过山车。
In many languages, the name refers to "Russian mountains".	许多语言仍使用“俄罗斯山”一词作为名字。
Contrastingly, in Russian, they are called "American mountains".	相反，俄语中称它们为“美国山”。
In the Scandinavian languages and German, the roller coaster is referred as "mountain-and-valley railway".	在北日耳曼语系和德语中，过山车被称为“山峦和山谷铁路”。
German also knows the word "Achterbahn", stemming from "Figur-8-Bahn", like Dutch "Achtbaan", relating to the form of the number 8 ("acht" in German and also Dutch).	德语中也用“Achterbahn”一词，来源于“Figur-8-Bahn”，就像荷兰语的“Achtbaan”，与数字 8 的形状有关（德语和荷兰语的“acht”）。
Several height classifications have been used by parks and manufacturers in marketing their roller coasters, as well as enthusiasts within the industry.	游乐园和制造商在营销过山车时，以及行业内的爱好者使用了几种高度分类。
One classification, the kiddie coaster, is a roller coaster specifically designed for younger riders.	儿童过山车分类是指专门为儿童设计的过山车。
Following World War II, parks began pushing for more of them to be built in contrast to the height and age restrictions of standard designs at the time.	第二次世界大战后，公园不管当时标准设计的高度和年龄限制，开始建造更多过山车。
Companies like Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) developed scaled-down versions of their larger models to accommodate the demand.	Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) 等公司开发了大型版本的缩小版，以满足需求。
These typically featured lift hills smaller than 25 feet (7.6 m), and still do today.	这种特别的爬升坡高度不足 25 英尺（7.6 米），迄今仍是这个高度。
The rise of kiddie coasters soon led to the development of "junior" models that had lift hills up to 45 feet (14 m).	儿童过山车的兴起很快促进了“小型”过山车的发展，这种模式的过山车坡度高达 45 英尺（14 米）。
A notable example of a junior coaster is the Sea Dragon – the oldest operating roller coaster from PTC's legendary designer John Allen – which opened at Wyandot Lake in 1956 near Powell, Ohio.	小型过山车的一个显著的例子是 Sea Dragon 过山车，由 PTC 的传奇设计师约翰·艾伦设计，1956 年在俄亥俄州鲍威尔附近的怀恩湖开放，是现存最古老的过山车。
A hypercoaster, occasionally stylized as hyper coaster, is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least 200 feet (61 m).	大型过山车有时又称“超级过山车”，是一种上升和下降幅度至少为 200 英尺（61 米）的过山车。
Moonsault Scramble, which debuted at Fuji-Q Highland in 1984, was the first to break this barrier, though the term hypercoaster was first coined by Cedar Point and Arrow Dynamics with the opening of Magnum XL-200 in 1989.	Moonsault Scramble 过山车于 1984 年在日本富士急乐园首次开放，是首款打破这一障碍的过山车，尽管“超级过山车”这一名称是衫点乐园和 Arrow point 公司 1989 年在开放 Magnum XL-200 过山车时首创的。
Hypercoasters have become one of the most predominant types of roller coasters in the world, now led by manufacturers Bolliger & Mabillard and Intamin.	超级过山车已经变成世界上最主要的过山车种类之一，而Bolliger&Mabillard 公司以及 Intamin 公司是现在世界上最大的超级过山车制造商。
Salmon eggs are laid in freshwater streams typically at high latitudes.	三文鱼通常在海拔较高的淡水河产卵。
The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry.	卵孵化成小鲑鱼或鲑鱼苗。
The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes.	鲑鱼苗会迅速长成幼鲑，它们身上有竖条纹，用以伪装自己。
The parr stay for six months to three years in their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily rubbed off.	幼鲑在自己出生的溪流里待上 6个月到 3 年的时间，就会长成二龄鲑，二龄鲑的一大特点浑身银光闪闪，身上的鳞片很容易被蹭掉。
Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage.	所有的三文鱼卵中，只有 10% 的卵能活到这一阶段。
The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water.	二龄鲑体内的化学物质会发生变化，从而得以在海水中生存。
While a few species of salmon remain in fresh water throughout their life cycle, the majority are anadromous and migrate to the ocean for maturation: in these species, smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean.	虽然有几种三文鱼一生都生活在淡水中，但绝大多数三文鱼都是在淡水河出生，在海里长大成熟。这种三文鱼在二龄鲑时期会花一部分时间生活在微咸水里，此时它们体内会发生化学反应，帮助它们适应大海里的渗透调节。
The salmon spend about one to five years (depending on the species) in the open ocean, where they gradually become sexually mature.	三文鱼会在大海里生活 1 到 5 年（具体视种类而定），然后就会达到性成熟。
The adult salmon then return primarily to their natal streams to spawn.	然后，成年的三文鱼就会回去产卵，主要是回到它们出生的溪流。
Atlantic salmon spend between one and four years at sea.	大西洋鲑会在大海中生活 1 到 4 年。
When a fish returns after just one year's sea feeding, it is called a grilse in Canada, Britain, and Ireland. Grilse may be present at spawning, and go unnoticed by large males, releasing their own sperm on the eggs.	只在海中养育了一年就打道回府的三文鱼，在加拿大、英国和爱尔兰被称为早熟鲑。早熟鲑会在产卵时现身，它们在大的雄性鲑不注意的情况下，把自己的精子释放在卵子上。
Prior to spawning, depending on the species, salmon undergo changes.	在产卵之前，三文鱼会发生一些变化，具体视其所属种类而定。
They may grow a hump, develop canine-like teeth, or develop a kype (a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male salmon).	它们可能会长出一个驼峰，一颗犬齿，或一个钩吻（雄鲑下颚处的明显弧状）。
All change from the silvery blue of a fresh-run fish from the sea to a darker colour.	所有的鲑鱼，都会由刚从海里游到河川时的银灰蓝，变成更深的颜色。
Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids to reproduce.	三文鱼是伟大的旅行家，为了繁衍后代，有时不惜逆着强流和急流回溯几百公里。
Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho, for example, travel over 1,400 km (900 mi) and climb nearly 2,100 m (7,000 ft) from the Pacific Ocean as they return to spawn.	例如，爱达荷中部的王鲑和红鲑会从太平洋游 1400 公里（900 英里），再向上游 2100 米（7000 英尺），回到原来的地方去产卵。
Condition tends to deteriorate the longer the fish remain in fresh water, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn, when they are known as kelts.	随着在淡水中待的时间变长，鲑鱼的状况开始走下坡路，产卵后还会进一步恶化。这时的鲑鱼被称为产卵鲑。
In all species of Pacific salmon, the mature individuals die within a few days or weeks of spawning, a trait known as semelparity.	成年鲑产卵后几天或几周后就会死去，所有种类的太平洋鲑都是这样，这样的特性被称为一次生殖。
Between 2 and 4% of Atlantic salmon kelts survive to spawn again, all females.	有 2% 到 4% 的大西洋鲑能够存活下来进行再次繁殖，这种鲑全部是雌性。
However, even in those species of salmon that may survive to spawn more than once (iteroparity), postspawning mortality is quite high (perhaps as high as 40 to 50%).	然而，即便能够存活下来进行多次繁殖（反复生殖），这些种类的鲑产卵后死亡率也是非常高的（可能高达 40% 至 50%）。
To lay her roe, the female salmon uses her tail (caudal fin), to create a low-pressure zone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, excavating a shallow depression, called a redd.	为了产卵，雌鲑会用尾巴（尾鳍）弄出一个低压区。它们会把砂砾挖松，让河水冲到下游，挖出一个浅洼地，叫做产卵床。
The redd may sometimes contain 5,000 eggs covering 2.8 m² (30 sq ft).	产卵床有时面积可达 2.8 平方米（30 平方英尺），可容纳 5000 个卵。
The eggs usually range from orange to red.	卵的颜色通常为橘色到红色不等。
One or more males approach the female in her redd, depositing sperm, or milt, over the roe.	一条或一条以上的雄鲑会来到产卵床的雌鲑跟前，把精子或精液释放在卵子上面。
The female then covers the eggs by disturbing the gravel at the upstream edge of the depression before moving on to make another redd.	接下来，雌鲑会在凹洼上游的一端搅动砂砾，让砂砾把卵埋起来，然后再继续前进做下一个产卵床。
The female may make as many as seven redds before her supply of eggs is exhausted.	在所有的卵全部排完之前，雌鲑会一直造产卵床，可能会有多达七个。
Each year, the fish experiences a period of rapid growth, often in summer, and one of slower growth, normally in winter.	一年中，鱼类会经历一个快速生长期，通常是在夏季；一个缓慢生长期，一般是在冬季。
This results in ring formation around an earbone called the otolith (annuli), analogous to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk.	这就导致鱼类耳骨周围形成轮纹，称为耳石（轮），类似于树干上肉眼可见的生长年轮。
Freshwater growth shows as densely crowded rings, sea growth as widely spaced rings; spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is converted into eggs and milt.	淡水生长表现为排列密集的轮，海水生长表现为间隔较宽的轮。产卵时的特征则是轮纹出现明显的腐蚀，因为鱼的体质量转化成了鱼精和鱼卵。
Freshwater streams and estuaries provide important habitat for many salmon species.	淡水溪流和河口为许多种类的三文鱼提供了重要的栖息地。
They feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young, and primarily on other fish when older.	它们年幼时以陆生和水生昆虫、片脚类生物以及其它甲壳类动物为食，长大后则主要以其它鱼类为食。
Eggs are laid in deeper water with larger gravel, and need cool water and good water flow (to supply oxygen) to the developing embryos.	卵被产在较深、砂砾较大的水域，发育中的胚胎需要凉爽的水温和流动性好的水流（以保证供氧）。
Mortality of salmon in the early life stages is usually high due to natural predation and human-induced changes in habitat, such as siltation, high water temperatures, low oxygen concentration, loss of stream cover, and reductions in river flow.	鲑鱼在生命早期死亡率通常很高，原因一个是自然捕食，一个是人为因素导致栖息地发生变化，如淤积、水温升高、含氧量降低、河流覆盖面积减少以及河流流量变少等。
Estuaries and their associated wetlands provide vital nursery areas for the salmon prior to their departure to the open ocean.	河口以及河口湿地，为出发前往大海之前的鲑鱼提供了重要的育幼场所。
Wetlands not only help buffer the estuary from silt and pollutants, but also provide important feeding and hiding areas.	湿地不仅有助于缓存河口沉积物和污染物，而且是一处重要的觅食和藏身之所。
Salmon not killed by other means show greatly accelerated deterioration (phenoptosis, or "programmed aging") at the end of their lives.	没有在其它方式下丧命的鲑鱼，则会在生命的最后阶段出现急速衰老（机体衰老，或“”程序性衰老）。
Their bodies rapidly deteriorate right after they spawn as a result of the release of massive amounts of corticosteroids.	一旦产卵完毕，它们的身体状况便会迅速衰弱下去，这是由于释放了大量皮质类固醇的缘故。
In the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, salmon are keystone species, supporting wildlife such as birds, bears and otters.	在太平洋西北部以及阿拉斯加，鲑鱼是支撑鸟类、熊、水濑等野生动物的生存的关键物种。
The bodies of salmon represent a transfer of nutrients from the ocean, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, to the forest ecosystem.	鲑鱼以自己的身体，将富含氮、硫、碳、磷的海洋营养物质从海洋转移到森林生态系统。
Grizzly bears function as ecosystem engineers, capturing salmon and carrying them into adjacent wooded areas.	灰熊扮演着生态系统工程师的角色，它们捕捉鲑鱼，并把鲑鱼带到附近的林地里。
There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and feces and partially eaten carcasses.	它们在那里留下了营养丰富的尿液和粪便，以及吃剩的鲑鱼尸体。
Bears are estimated to leave up to half the salmon they harvest on the forest floor, in densities that can reach 4,000 kilograms per hectare, providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the riparian woodlands.	据估计，熊捕捉的鲑鱼会有一半吃不完而留在林地上，密度可达每公顷 4000 公斤，为河岸林地带来的氮占该地氮总量的 24%。
The foliage of spruce trees up to 500 m (1,600 ft) from a stream where grizzlies fish salmon have been found to contain nitrogen originating from fished salmon.	在有灰熊捉鱼为食的河流，高达 500 米（1600 英尺）的云杉的叶子被发现含有氮，这里的氮就是来自被捕的鲑鱼。
It has been discovered that rivers which have seen a decline or disappearance of anadromous lampreys, loss of the lampreys also affects the salmon in a negative way.	人们发现，在溯河性七鳃鳗数量已经减少甚至消失的河流，七鳃鳗的减少也对鲑鱼产生了负面的影响。
Like salmon, anadromous lampreys stop feeding and die after spawning, and their decomposing bodies release nutrients into the stream.	溯河性七鳃鳗和鲑鱼一样，产卵后会停止进食并死去，它们的尸体腐烂后会向河里释放出各种营养物质。
Also, along with species like rainbow trout and Sacramento sucker, lampreys clean the gravel in the rivers during spawning.	此外，和虹鳟以及塞城亚口鱼等鱼种一样，七鳃鳗产卵时会清理河里的砂砾。
Their larvae, called ammocoetes, are filter feeders which contribute to the health of the waters.	它们的仔鱼被称为幼七鳃鳗，是滤食动物，有助于保持水质健康。
They are also a food source for the young salmon, and being fattier and oilier, it is assumed predators prefer them over salmon offspring, taking off some of the predation pressure on smolts.	它们也是小鲑鱼的食物来源，而且，由于幼七鳃鳗更肥，含油量更高，因此可以假定那些捕食者可能更喜欢幼七鳃鳗而非小鲑鱼，这一定程度上减轻了小鲑鱼被捕的压力。
Adult lampreys are also the preferred prey of seals and sea lions, which can eat 30 lampreys to every salmon, allowing more adult salmon to enter the rivers to spawn without being eaten by the marine mammals.	成年七鳃鳗也是海豹和海狮的首选，它们每吃 30 条七鳃鳗才会吃一条鲑鱼，这就使得更多的成年鲑能够避免被海洋动物捕食，得以进入河流产卵。
According to Canadian biologist Dorothy Kieser, the myxozoan parasite Henneguya salminicola is commonly found in the flesh of salmonids.	根据加拿大生物学家多萝西·基瑟的说法，鲑鱼鱼肉中通常存在“鲑居尾孢虫”这种粘原虫寄生虫。
It has been recorded in the field samples of salmon returning to the Haida Gwaii Islands.	在对返回海达瓜依群岛的鲑鱼进行野外取样时，就出现过这方面的记录。
The fish responds by walling off the parasitic infection into a number of cysts that contain milky fluid.	鱼的反应是形成许多含有乳白色汁液的囊肿，将寄生感染隔离在这些囊肿中。
This fluid is an accumulation of a large number of parasites.	这种汁液中积累了大量的寄生虫。
Henneguya and other parasites in the myxosporean group have complex life cycles, where the salmon is one of two hosts.	尾孢虫以及其它粘原虫种属的寄生虫有着复杂的生命周期，在其生命周期之内，它们会寄宿两大宿主身上，其中一个是鲑鱼。
The fish releases the spores after spawning.	鱼产卵后会释放出寄生虫孢子。
In the Henneguya case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream.	以尾孢虫为例，尾孢虫孢子会进入第二宿主体内，而第二宿主极有可能是产卵河溪中的无脊椎动物。
When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon.	当幼鲑迁徙回海洋时，第二宿主会释放出孢子，使幼鲑被感染。
The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle.	然后寄生虫寄居在鲑鱼体内，直到下一次产卵，如此循环。
The myxosporean parasite that causes whirling disease in trout has a similar life cycle.	会让鳟鱼得眩晕病的粘原虫寄生虫也有着类似的生命周期。
However, as opposed to whirling disease, the Henneguya infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon—even heavily infected fish tend to return to spawn successfully.	然而，与得晕眩病的情况相反，感染了尾孢虫的宿主鲑鱼似乎并不会因此得病——即便是被重度感染的鲑鱼，最终也能成功返回出生地产卵。
According to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on Henneguya salminicola was done by scientists at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report which states, "the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections.	根据凯泽博士的说法，20 世纪 80 年代中期，纳奈莫太平洋生物站的科学家对鲑居尾孢虫进行了大量的研究，特别是在一份概述报告中，他们这样指出：“幼年时在淡水中待的时间越长的鲑鱼，感染就越明显。”
Hence in order of prevalence, coho are most infected followed by sockeye, chinook, chum and pink.	因此，按感染率排序，银鲑是受感染最严重的，其次是红鲑、王鲑、狗鲑、粉鲑。
As well, the report says, at the time the studies were conducted, stocks from the middle and upper reaches of large river systems in British Columbia such as Fraser, Skeena, Nass and from mainland coastal streams in the southern half of B.C., "are more likely to have a low prevalence of infection." The report also states, "It should be stressed that Henneguya, economically deleterious though it is, is harmless from the view of public health.	此外，该报告还指出，在进行该研究的那个时期，来自不列颠哥伦比亚省内的大型河流系统（如弗雷则河、斯基纳河、纳斯河）的中上游以及该省南部内陆及沿海河流的鲑鱼“感染率更有可能保持在低水平”。该报告还表示，“应该强调的是，鲑居尾孢虫虽然对水产经济有害，但从公共健康的角度来看是无害的。
It is strictly a fish parasite that cannot live in or affect warm blooded animals, including man".	它们是专门针对鱼类的寄生虫，无法寄生在温血动物体内或影响温血动物，包括人类。”
According to Klaus Schallie, Molluscan Shellfish Program Specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, "Henneguya salminicola is found in southern B.C. also and in all species of salmon.	加拿大食品检验局软体贝类项目专家克劳斯·沙利表示，“不列颠哥伦比亚南部也发现了鲑居尾孢虫，所有的鲑鱼种类都受到了感染。
I have previously examined smoked chum salmon sides that were riddled with cysts and some sockeye runs in Barkley Sound (southern B.C., west coast of Vancouver Island) are noted for their high incidence of infestation."	我之前就检验过到处布满囊肿的烟熏狗鲑鱼块，而且，巴克利湾（不列颠哥伦比亚省南部，温哥华岛西岸）里的一些红鲑也因其高感染发生率而出名。“
Sea lice, particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis and various Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon.	海虱，尤其是鲑疮痂鱼虱以及各种鱼虱属，包括 C.clemensi 和 C.rogercresseyi，会对野生鲑鱼和养殖鲑鱼造成致命的感染。
Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days.	海虱是一种体表寄生虫，会在浮游无节幼体期以及桡足幼体期期间依附到野生鲑鱼体表，以鱼体分泌的粘液、血液和皮肤为食，为期数日。
Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms	大量密集养殖的开放式鲑鱼养殖场
can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result.	可能造成海虱泛滥，许多野生小鲑鱼在通过布置有大量开放式养殖场的河口时被海虱感染，因而没能存活下来。
Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable.	成年鲑感染海虱的数量只要不超过临界值就有可能存活下来，但幼鲑年幼皮薄，在迁徙至大海的过程中极其容易夭折。
On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%.	在加拿大太平洋沿岸的一些海域，感染鱼虱致死的粉红鲑数量通常超过 80%。
The risk of injury caused by underwater pile driving has been studied by Dr. Halvorsen and her co-workers.	哈尔沃森博士及其同事对水下打桩可能带来的危害进行了研究。
The study concluded that the fish are at risk of injury if the cumulative sound exposure level exceeds 210 dB relative to 1 μPa² s.	该研究的结论是，如果累计的表征声压级相对于1 帕斯卡超过 210 分贝，就可能会对鱼类造成伤害。
As can be seen from the production chart at the left, the global capture reported by different countries to the FAO of commercial wild salmon has remained fairly steady since 1990 at about one million tonnes per year.	从左边的产量图可以看出，不同国家向粮农组织所报告的野生三文鱼的全球商业捕捞量自 1990 年以来一直保持在每年约 100 万吨的稳定水平。
This is in contrast to farmed salmon (below) which has increased in the same period from about 0.6 million tonnes to well over two million tonnes.	这与养殖鲑（见下图）的情况形成了鲜明对比，后者同一时期从 60 万吨左右一路飙升至 200 吨以上。
Nearly all captured wild salmon are Pacific salmon.	几乎所有野外捕捞的鲑鱼都是太平洋鲑。
The capture of wild Atlantic salmon has always been relatively small, and has declined steadily since 1990.	野外捕捞的大西洋鲑数量一直相对较少，并且自 1990 年以来逐年下降。
In 2011 only 2,500 tonnes were reported.	2011 年上报的数量只有 2500 吨。
In contrast about half of all farmed salmon are Atlantic salmon.	相比之下，所有的养殖鲑中，大约有一半是大西洋鲑。
Recreational salmon fishing can be a technically demanding kind of sport fishing, not necessarily congenial for beginning fishermen.	娱乐性三文鱼垂钓可能技术要求较高，这样的钓鱼运动对刚入门的垂钓者可能不太适合。
A conflict exists between commercial fishermen and recreational fishermen for the right to salmon stock resources.	商业性捕捞者和娱乐性垂钓者之间存在冲突，大家都想争夺三文鱼资源的占有权。
Commercial fishing in estuaries and coastal areas is often restricted so enough salmon can return to their natal rivers where they can spawn and be available for sport fishing.	河口和沿海地区通常禁止商业捕捞，因此有足够的三文鱼得以回到自己出生的河流，它们在那里产卵的同时，也为垂钓运动带来了垂钓对象。
On parts of the North American west coast sport salmon fishing completely replaces inshore commercial fishing.	在北美西海岸部分地区，三文鱼垂钓运动完全取代了近海商业捕捞。
In most cases, the commercial value of a salmon can be several times less than the value attributed to the same fish caught by a sport fisherman.	大多数情况下，一条三文鱼的商业价值要比垂钓这条鱼所带来的娱乐价值要低好几倍。
This is "a powerful economic argument for allocating stock resources preferentially to sport fishing."	这是“将鱼资源优先分配给娱乐性垂钓在经济上的一个强有力论据”。
Salmon aquaculture is a major contributor to the world production of farmed finfish, representing about US$10 billion annually.	三文鱼养殖占全世界有鳍鱼养殖总产量很大一部分，每年产值约 100 亿美元。
Other commonly cultured fish species include tilapia, catfish, sea bass, carp and bream.	其它常见的养殖鱼种类还有罗非鱼、鲶鱼、海鲈、鲤鱼和鲷鱼等。
Salmon farming is significant in Chile, Norway, Scotland, Canada and the Faroe Islands; it is the source for most salmon consumed in the United States and Europe.	智利、挪威、苏格兰、加拿大以及法罗群岛的三文鱼养殖业非常发达，欧美两地所消费的三文鱼大多数来源于这些地区。
Atlantic salmon are also, in very small volumes, farmed in Russia and Tasmania, Australia.	大西洋三文鱼在俄罗斯、塔斯马尼亚、澳洲也有养殖，但产量非常小。
Salmon are carnivorous.	三文鱼是肉食性动物。
They are fed a meal produced from catching other wild fish and other marine organisms.	要捕捉其它野生鱼类和其它海洋生物作来为饲料喂养它们。
Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild forage fish.	三文鱼养殖对野生饵料鱼的需求量很大。
Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product.	三文鱼需要摄入大量的蛋白质营养，而且养殖的三文鱼出栏时的成品量还比不上三文鱼所吃掉的饵料鱼的量。
On a dry weight basis, 2–4 kg of wild-caught fish are needed to produce one kg of salmon.	就干重来说，每产出一公斤三文鱼，就需要消耗 2 至 4 公斤的野生鱼。
As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield.	随着三文鱼养殖产业规模扩大，人们需要更多的野生饵料鱼作为饲料，而目前， 全世界受监测的渔场中， 75% 的渔场已经接近甚至超过了自己的最大持续渔获量。
The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.	为了供应三文鱼养殖而对野生饵料鱼进行工业化规模的提取，这样的做法影响了以该饵料鱼为食的野生鱼类的生存。
Work continues on substituting vegetable proteins for animal proteins in the salmon diet.	人们仍在研究如何在三文鱼的饮食中加入植物蛋白以替代动物蛋白。
This substitution results in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 fatty acid content in the farmed product.	这样的替换会导致颇受市场青睐的欧米伽-3 脂肪酸在养殖鲑中的含量降低。
Intensive salmon farming uses open-net cages, which have low production costs.	集约化三文鱼养殖场使用开放式网箱，生产成本很低。
Persea americana is a tree that grows to 20 m (66 ft), with alternately arranged leaves 12–25 cm (4.7–9.8 in) long.	鳄梨是一种可以长到 20 米（66 英尺）的树，叶子交替排列，长 12 至 25 厘米（4.7 至 9.8 英寸）。
Panicles of flowers with deciduous bracts arise from new growth or the axils of leaves.	长出新的叶子时或者叶腋处会形成圆锥花序，苞片具有落叶性。
The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, 5–10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) wide.	花不显眼，呈黄绿色，宽 5 至 10 毫米（0.2 至 0.4 英寸）。
The species is variable because of selection pressure by humans to produce larger, fleshier fruits with a thinner exocarp.	这种植物物种会在人类选择的压力下发生变化，因为人总是喜欢个头更大、皮更薄肉更多的果实。
The avocado fruit is a climacteric, single-seeded berry, due to the imperceptible endocarp covering the seed, rather than a drupe.	鳄梨果是一种呼吸跃变型水果，只有一颗种子，由于隐蔽的内果皮裹住了种子，因此，鳄梨是一种浆果而非核果。
The pear-shaped fruit is 7–20 cm (2.8–7.9 in) long, weighs between 100 and 1,000 g (3.5 and 35.3 oz), and has a large central seed, 5–6.4 cm (2.0–2.5 in) long.	这种梨状的果实长 7 至 20 厘米（2.8 至 7.9 英寸），重 100 至 1000 克（3.5 至 35.3 盎司），中间有一枚大种子，种子长 5 至 6.4 厘米（2.0至 2.5 英寸）。
Persea americana, or the avocado, possibly originated in the Tehuacan Valley in the state of Puebla, Mexico, although fossil evidence suggests similar species were much more widespread millions of years ago.	鳄梨又叫牛油果，可能起源于墨西哥普埃布拉州的特瓦坎山谷，但有化石证据表明，数百万年前类似物种的分布要比这广泛得多。
However, there is evidence for three possible separate domestications of the avocado, resulting in the currently recognized Mexican (aoacatl), Guatemalan (quilaoacatl), and West Indian (tlacacolaocatl) landraces.	然而，有证据表明，鳄梨一开始可能分属于三种不同的培育品种，后来演化成了目前公认的墨西哥鳄梨（aoacatl）、危地马拉鳄梨（quiaoacatl）以及西印度群岛鳄梨（tlacacolaocatl）。
The Mexican and Guatemalan landraces originated in the highlands of those countries, while the West Indian landrace is a lowland variety that ranges from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador to Peru, achieving a wide range through human agency before the arrival of the Europeans.	墨西哥和危地马拉品种源自于这两个国家的高地，而西印度群岛品种则是一种低地品种，分布在危地马拉、哥斯达黎加、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔和秘鲁等地，在欧洲人到来之前，该品种曾在人为的作用下得到了广泛分布。
The three separate landraces were most likely to have already intermingled in pre-Columbian America and were described in the Florentine Codex.	这三种相互独立的地方品种很有可能在哥伦布发现美洲之前已经混种，这一点在佛罗伦萨法典中有相关描述。
The earliest residents were living in temporary camps in an ancient wetland eating avocados, chilies, mollusks, sharks, birds, and sea lions.	古代最早的居民生活在湿地的临时营地里，以鳄梨、辣椒、软体动物、鲨鱼、鸟类和海狮为食。
The oldest discovery of an avocado pit comes from Coxcatlan Cave, dating from around 9,000 to 10,000 years ago.	最古老的鳄梨核发现于考克斯卡特兰洞，可追溯到 9000 到 10000 年前。
Other caves in the Tehuacan Valley from around the same time period also show early evidence for the presence of avocado.	差不多同时期，在特瓦坎河谷的其他洞穴也发现了证据，证明鳄梨很早以前就已存在。
There is evidence for avocado use at Norte Chico civilization sites in Peru by at least 3,200 years ago and at Caballo Muerto in Peru from around 3,800 to 4,500 years ago.	秘鲁小北文化遗址的发现证明至少 3200 年前人类就已经食用鳄梨，而秘鲁 Caballo Muerto 的发现可以追溯到 3800 年至 4500 年以前。
The native, undomesticated variety is known as a criollo, and is small, with dark black skin, and contains a large seed.	本地未被驯化的品种叫 criollo，个小，果皮很黑，内含一枚大种子。
It probably coevolved with extinct megafauna.	该品种可能与已经灭绝的巨型动物是相互进化的关系。
The avocado tree also has a long history of cultivation in Central and South America, likely beginning as early as 5,000 BC.	鳄梨树在中美洲和南美洲也有很长的栽培历史，可能早在公元前 5000 年就已经开始有人种植。
A water jar shaped like an avocado, dating to AD 900, was discovered in the pre-Incan city of Chan Chan.	在前印加时代的昌昌古城发现了一个形似鳄梨的水罐，其历史可追溯到公元 900 年。
The earliest known written account of the avocado in Europe is that of Martín Fernández de Enciso (circa 1470–1528) in 1519 in his book, Suma De Geographia Que Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo.	在欧洲，已知关于鳄梨的最早书面记载出现在 Martín Fernández de Enciso (约 1470–1528)  于1519 年所写的《 Suma De Geographia Que Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo》一书中。
The first detailed account that unequivocally describes the avocado was given by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés in his work Sumario de la natural historia de las Indias in 1526.	1526 年，Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés 在其著作《印度自然历史概论》中首次明确地对鳄梨进行了详尽的描述。
The first written record in English of the use of the word 'avocado' was by Hans Sloane, who coined the term, in a 1696 index of Jamaican plants.	英语中关于“鳄梨”一词的首次书面使用的记录是由汉斯·斯隆作出的，1696 年他为牙买加的植物编索引时创造了这个词。
The plant was introduced to Spain in 1601, Indonesia around 1750, Mauritius in 1780, Brazil in 1809, the United States mainland in 1825, South Africa and Australia in the late 19th century, and Israel in 1908.	这种植物于 1601 年被引入西班牙，1750 年左右被引入印度尼西亚，1780 年被引入毛里求斯，1809 年被引入巴西，1825 年被引入美国本土，19 世纪末被引入南非和澳大利亚，1908 年被引入以色列。
In the United States, the avocado was introduced to Florida and Hawaii in 1833 and in California in 1856.	在美国，鳄梨于 1833 年被引入佛罗里达和夏威夷，1856年被引入加利福尼亚。
Before 1915, the avocado was commonly referred to in California as ahuacate and in Florida as alligator pear.	1915 年以前，鳄梨在加利福尼亚被称为“ahuacate”，在佛罗里达则被称为“alligator pear（短吻鳄梨）”。
In 1915, the California Avocado Association introduced the then-innovative term avocado to refer to the plant.	1915 年，加利福尼亚鳄梨委员会用当时颇具创新意味的一个术语“鳄梨”来指代这种植物。
The word "avocado" comes from the Spanish aguacate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ], which goes back to the proto-Aztecan *pa:wa which also meant "avocado".	 "鳄梨" 这个词来源于西班牙语中的 aguacate，而 aguacate 又来源于那瓦特语中的 āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ]，而 ahuacatl 又要追溯到原始阿兹特克语中的 *pa:wa，同样也是“鳄梨”的意思。
Sometimes the Nahuatl word was used with the meaning "testicle", probably because of the likeness between the fruit and the body part.	有时候这个那瓦特语单词又会用来指代“睾丸”，也许是因为鳄梨和这一身体部位之间存在着相似之处。
The modern English name comes from an English rendering of the Spanish aguacate as avogato.	鳄梨现在的英文名称源自于西班牙语单词"aguacate"的英译版本"avogato"。
The earliest known written use in English is attested from 1697 as "avogato pear", a term which was later corrupted as "alligator pear".	经证实，关于鳄梨，英语中已知的最早书面表达是 1697 年的“avogato pear”，后来用着用着就变成了“alligator pear”。
Because the word avogato sounded like "advocate", several languages reinterpreted it to have that meaning.	因为“avogato”这个词听起来像"avocate（律师）"，因此，好几种语言都对这个词重新进行了解释，给它加上这一层意思。
French uses avocat, which also means lawyer, and "advocate" — forms of the word appear in several Germanic languages, such as the (now obsolete) German Advogato-Birne, the old Danish advokat-pære (today it is called avocado) and the Dutch advocaatpeer.	法语中用的是“avocat”，也是律师的意思，而对于 "advocate" ，好几种日耳曼语言中出现了这个词的形态，如德语中“Advogato-Birne（现已过时）”， 古丹麦语中的“advokat-pære ”（现在叫“ avocado”）”以及荷兰语中的“advocaatpeer”。
In other Central American and Caribbean Spanish-speaking countries, it is known by the Mexican name, while South American Spanish-speaking countries use a Quechua-derived word, palta.	在其他中美洲以及加勒比的西班牙语国家中，鳄梨以某个墨西哥名称为大家所熟知，而在南美的西班牙语国家中，人们用的是克丘亚语中衍生出来的一个词：palta。
In Portuguese, it is abacate.	葡萄牙语中用的是“abacate”。
The fruit is sometimes called an avocado pear or alligator pear (due to its shape and the rough green skin of some cultivars).	这种水果有时叫“油梨”或“鳄鱼梨”（因某些品种的外形及绿色粗糙的果皮形似鳄鱼）
The Nahuatl āhuacatl can be compounded with other words, as in ahuacamolli, meaning avocado soup or sauce, from which the Spanish word guacamole derives.	那瓦特语中的“āhuacatl”还可以与其它词复合起来用，如“ahuacamolli”, 意为鳄梨汤或鳄梨酱 ，西班牙语单词“guacamole”就是从这个词衍生出来的。
In the United Kingdom, the term avocado pear is still sometimes misused as applied when avocados first became commonly available in the 1960s.	在英国，“鳄梨”有时仍然会被误用，以为这个词是用在 20 世纪 60 年代鳄梨刚开始兴起那会。
Originating as a diminutive in Australian English, a clipped form, avo, has since become a common colloquialism in South Africa and the United Kingdom.	“avo”这个缩略词最初是澳洲英语中的一个指小词，现在已经变成南非人和英国人口语中经常用到的一个词。
It is known as "butter fruit" in parts of India.	在印度部分地区，鳄梨又称为黄油果。
The subtropical species needs a climate without frost and with little wind.	这种亚热带品种要在无霜风小的气候中生长。
High winds reduce the humidity, dehydrate the flowers, and affect pollination.	风太大会降低湿度，使花朵缺水，从而影响授粉。
When even a mild frost occurs, premature fruit drop may occur, although the 'Hass' cultivar can tolerate temperatures down to −1 °C.	即便霜冻不严重，也可能会出现果实未熟就提前脱落的现象，尽管“哈斯”品种可以忍受低至 -1°c 的温度。
Several cold-hardy varieties are planted in the region of Gainesville, Florida, which survive temperatures as low as −6.5 °C (20 °F) with only minor leaf damage.	有几种耐寒品种被种植在弗罗里达州盖恩斯维尔市这一带，这些品种可以在低至 -6.5°c（20 华氏度）的温度下生存，只表现出轻微的叶片损伤。
The trees also need well-aerated soils, ideally more than 1 m deep.	这种树还需要透气性良好的土壤，土壤深度最好超过 1 米。
According to information published by the Water Footprint Network, it takes an average of approximately 70 litres (18 US gal) of applied fresh ground or surface water, not including rainfall or natural moisture in the soil, to grow one avocado.	根据水足迹网络公开的资料，种植一株鳄梨树平均需要约 70 升（18 加仑）的地表淡水或地下淡水进行灌溉，其中不包括降雨量和土壤中的自然水分。
However, the amount of water needed depends on where it is grown; for example, in the main avocado-growing region of Chile, about 320 litres (85 US gal) of applied water are needed to grow one avocado.	不过，需要多少用水量还得看树种在什么地方。比如，在智利主要的鳄梨种植区，种植一株鳄梨大约需要灌溉 320 升（85 加仑）的水。
Yield is reduced when the irrigation water is highly saline.	如果灌溉水含盐量很高，就会导致植株减产。
These soil and climate conditions are available in southern and eastern Colombia, Morocco, the Levant, South Africa, Venezuela, Spain, Peru, parts of central and northern Chile, Vietnam, Indonesia, parts of southern India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, southern California, Arizona, Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, Hawaii, Ecuador, and Rwanda.	具备这些土壤条件和气候条件的地区有：哥伦比亚南部和东部、摩洛哥、黎凡特、南非、委内瑞拉、西班牙、秘鲁、智利中部和北部的部分地区、越南、印度尼西亚、印度南部部分地区、斯里兰卡、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾群岛、马来西亚、中美洲、加勒比、墨西哥、南加州、亚利桑那、波多黎各、德克萨斯州、佛罗里达州、夏威夷、厄瓜多尔、卢旺达。
Each region has different cultivars.	每个地区的品种都各不相同。
Commercial orchards produce an average of seven tonnes per hectare each year, with some orchards achieving 20 tonnes per hectare.	商业性鳄梨种植园平均每年每公顷产出 7 吨，一些果园能达到每公顷 20 吨。
Biennial bearing can be a problem, with heavy crops in one year being followed by poor yields the next.	每两年结一次果会导致一个问题：头一年收成很好，第二年收成很差。
Like the banana, the avocado is a climacteric fruit, which matures on the tree, but ripens off the tree.	鳄梨和香蕉一样，是一种呼吸跃变型果实，这种果实虽然在树上长成，但摘下来才会变熟。
Avocados used in commerce are picked hard and green and kept in coolers at 3.3 to 5.6 °C (37.9 to 42.1 °F) until they reach their final destination.	商业用途的鳄梨会在果实还很硬很绿的时候就摘下来，在运送到目的地之前会一直保存在 3.3°C 至 5.6°C（37.9 华氏度至 42.1 华氏度） 的冷却箱中。
Avocados must be mature to ripen properly.	鳄梨必须发育好才会熟得好。
Avocados that fall off the tree ripen on the ground.	从树上掉下来的鳄梨，会在地上变熟。
Generally, the fruit is picked once it reaches maturity; Mexican growers pick 'Hass' avocados when they have more than 23% dry matter, and other producing countries have similar standards.	通常情况下，鳄梨一旦长成就会被摘下来。但墨西哥的“哈斯”鳄梨果农会在果实中的干物质超过 23% 时进行采摘，而其他鳄梨生产国也有着类似的标准。
Once picked, avocados ripen in one to two weeks (depending on the cultivar) at room temperature (faster if stored with other fruits such as apples or bananas, because of the influence of ethylene gas).	摘下来的鳄梨在室温条件下放置 1 至 2 周（视品种而定）就会变熟（如果和苹果、香蕉等其他水果放在一起，由于乙烯气体的作用，会更快变熟）。
Some supermarkets sell ripened avocados which have been treated with synthetic ethylene to hasten ripening.	一些超市出售的熟鳄梨就是用人工合成的乙烯催熟的。
The use of an ethylene gas "ripening room", which is now an industry standard, was pioneered in the 1980s by farmer Gil Henry of Escondido, California, in response to footage from a hidden supermarket camera which showed shoppers repeatedly squeezing hard, unripe avocados, putting them "back in the bin," and moving on without making a purchase.	使用乙烯气体“熟成室”催熟水果如今已是行业标准，这种做法是 20 世纪 80 年代加利福尼亚埃斯孔迪多市的农民吉尔·亨利首创的，当时，一家超市的隐式监控拍下了一个镜头，从镜头里可以看见，人们在买不熟的鳄梨时会用力地捏来捏去，然后“放回箱子”里，什么都不买就走掉。针对这一现象，吉尔·亨利发明了这种催熟法。
In some cases, avocados can be left on the tree for several months, which is an advantage to commercial growers who seek the greatest return for their crop, but if the fruit remains unpicked for too long, it falls to the ground.	某些情况下，鳄梨可以留在树上好几个月不摘，这对于追求最大种植回报的商业种植者来说是一大利好。但如果太长时间不摘，果实就会自己掉到地上。
Avocados can be propagated by seed, taking roughly four to six years to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing.	鳄梨可以用种子繁殖，大约 4 到 6 年就会结果。但在某些情况下，幼苗需要 10 年的时间才能结出果实。
The offspring is unlikely to be identical to the parent cultivar in fruit quality.	在果实的品质方面，后代植株与母体植株是不可能一模一样的。
Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to rootstocks that are propagated by seed (seedling rootstocks) or by layering (clonal rootstocks).	因此，优良品种是通过嫁接到砧木上来进行繁殖的，而这些砧木可以通过种子繁殖（实生砧）或压条繁殖（无性系砧）的方式来进行培植。
After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young rootstocks are ready to be grafted.	在温室里生长大概一年时间后，砧木幼株就可以接受嫁接了。
Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used.	常见的嫁接手法有顶接和侧接。
The scion cultivar grows for another 6–12 months before the tree is ready to be sold.	接穗还要再生长 6 至 12 个月，该植株才能上市出售。
Clonal rootstocks are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor soil aeration or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by Phytophthora.	选择无性系砧木是因为需要对某种特定的土壤状况或病理状况有一定的耐受力，比如土壤通气性差、对疫霉菌引起的土传病（烂根病）有抗病性等。
Commercial avocado production is limited to a small fraction of the vast genetic diversity in the species.	鳄梨家族的品种非常丰富，目前商业化种植的品种仅限于很小的一部分。
Conservation of this genetic diversity has relied largely on field collection, as avocado seeds often do not survive storage in seed banks.	保护鳄梨的品种多样性主要依赖现场数据采集，因为鳄梨种子通常无法保存在种子库中。
This is problematic, as field preservation of living cultivars is expensive, and habitat loss threatens wild cultivars.	这会导致各种问题，因为对现存品种进行实地保存成本很高，而栖息地的减少又威胁着野生鳄梨品种的生存。
More recently, an alternate method of conservation has been developed based on cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos with reliable methods for somatic embryogenesis and reconstitution into living trees.	最近，一种新的保存方法被发明了出来，该方法基于对鳄梨的体细胞胚进行超低温储存，通过一些可靠的方式，在活立木内实现体胚发生和体胚重组。
Avocado trees are vulnerable to bacterial, viral, fungal, and nutritional diseases (excesses and deficiencies of key minerals).	鳄梨树易受细菌、病毒、真菌、营养性疾病（关键矿物质过剩或缺乏）的侵害。
Disease can affect all parts of the plant, causing spotting, rotting, cankers, pitting, and discoloration.	疾病会影响到植株的所有部位，导致植物出现病斑、腐烂、溃疡、点蚀和变色。
Mexico is by far the world's largest avocado growing country, producing several times more than the second largest producer.	墨西哥是目前世界上最大的鳄梨生产国，其产量是第二大鳄梨产国的好几倍。
In 2013, the total area dedicated to avocado production was 188,723 hectares (415,520 acres), and the harvest was 2.03 million tonnes in 2017.	2013 年，鳄梨种植面积总共为 188,723 公顷（415,520 英亩）；2017年，鳄梨的产量为 203 万吨。
The states that produce the most are México, Morelos, Nayarit, Puebla, and Michoacan, accounting for 86% of the total.	产量最高的州是墨西哥州、莫雷洛斯州、纳亚里特州、普埃布拉州以及米却肯州，占墨西哥总产量的 86%。
In Michoacán, the cultivation is complicated by the existence of drug cartels that extort protection fees from cultivators.	在米却肯州，鳄梨种植因贩毒集团的存在而变得复杂，因为贩毒集团会向种植者勒索保护费。
They are reported to exact 2000 Mexican pesos per hectare from avocado farmers and 1 to 3 pesos/kg of harvested fruit.	据报道，鳄梨果农每种植 1 公顷就要上缴 2000 墨西哥比索，每收获一公斤鳄梨就要上缴1 至 3 比索。
The avocado was introduced from Mexico to California in the 19th century, and has become a successful cash crop.	鳄梨于 19 世纪从墨西哥传入加利福尼亚州，从此成功变身为一颗“致富果”。
About 59,000 acres (240 km²) – some 95% of United States avocado production – is located in Southern California, with 60% in San Diego County.	南加州的鳄梨种植面积约 59000 公顷（240 平方公里）——占比全美总产量的95%——其中 60% 位于圣迭戈县。
Fallbrook, California claims, without official recognition, the title of "Avocado Capital of the World" (also claimed by the town of Uruapan in Mexico), and both Fallbrook and Carpinteria, California, host annual avocado festivals.	加利福尼亚州的福尔布鲁克有一个未经官方认证的称号，叫“世界鳄梨之都”（墨西哥乌鲁阿潘镇也有此称号）。加州的福尔布鲁克以及卡平特里亚每年都会举办鳄梨节。
Avocado is the official fruit of the State of California.	鳄梨是加利福尼亚州的州果。
Hass avocado production in Peru encompasses thousands of hectares in central and western Peru.	秘鲁中部和西部的哈斯鳄梨种植面积达数千公顷。
Peru has now become the largest supplier of avocados imported to the European Union and the second largest supplier to Asia and the United States.	秘鲁现在已经成为欧盟的最大鳄梨供应国、亚洲和美国的第二大鳄梨供应国。
Peru's location near the equator and along the Pacific Ocean creates consistently mild temperatures year round.	秘鲁位于赤道附近，濒临太平洋，全年气温温和。
The soil is rich and sandy and the towering Andes mountains provide a constant flow of pure water for irrigation.	这里的土壤肥沃多沙，高耸的阿尔卑斯山为该地的灌溉提供了源源不断的纯净水源。
Naturally sheltered as it is from heavy rain or freezing temperatures, Peru is an almost perfect climate for the cultivation of avocados.	秘鲁雨不大，气温也不高，气候条件非常适合种植鳄梨，是鳄梨的天然港湾。
Hass avocados from Peru are seasonally available to consumers from May through September and are promoted under the auspices of the Peruvian Avocado Commission, headquartered in Washington, D.C.	秘鲁的哈斯鳄梨是季节性供应的，会在每年的 5 月至 9 月在总部位于华盛顿特区的秘鲁鳄梨委员会的支持下推广上市。
Other avocado cultivars include 'Spinks'.	其他鳄梨品种还包括“斯宾克斯”。
Historically attested varieties (which may or may not survive among horticulturists) include the 'Challenge', 'Dickinson', 'Kist', 'Queen', 'Rey', 'Royal', 'Sharpless', and 'Taft'.	历史上被证实过的（经园艺家之手得以存活下来或未能存活的）鳄梨品种包括：“挑战”鳄梨、“迪金森”鳄梨、“吉斯特”鳄梨、“女王”鳄梨、“雷伊”鳄梨、“皇家”鳄梨、“夏普勒斯”鳄梨、“塔夫脱”鳄梨。
A stoneless avocado, marketed as a "cocktail avocado," which does not contain a pit, is available on a limited basis.	有一种无核鳄梨，市面上叫“鸡尾酒鳄梨”，这种鳄梨没有果核，目前市场供应量不大。
They are five to eight centimetres long; the whole fruit may be eaten, including the skin.	果长 5cm 至 8cm，整个水果都可以吃，包括果皮。
It is produced from an unpollinated blossom in which the seed does not develop.	这种鳄梨是未授粉的花朵结出的果，因此种子没有得到发育。
Seedless avocados regularly appear on trees.	鳄梨树上经常结出无核的鳄梨。
Known in the avocado industry as "cukes", they are usually discarded commercially due to their small size.	这种果实在鳄梨界被称为“黄瓜果”，在商业中由于个头太小通常被遗弃。
After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect in 1994, Mexico tried exporting avocados to the US.	1994 年《北美自由贸易协定》生效后，墨西哥开始尝试将鳄梨出口到美国。
The US government resisted, claiming the trade would introduce Tephritidae fruit flies that would destroy California's crops.	美国政府不同意，声称这种交易会将实蝇科果蝇带进来，对加州的农作物造成威胁。
The Mexican government responded by inviting USDA inspectors to Mexico, but the US government declined, claiming fruit fly inspection was not feasible.	墨西哥政府对此的回应是邀请美国农业部检测员前往墨西哥检测，但美国政府拒绝了，理由是果蝇检测行不通。
The Mexican government then proposed to sell avocados only to the northeastern US in the winter (fruit flies cannot withstand extreme cold).	墨西哥政府于是提议只在冬季将鳄梨销往美国东北部（果蝇在极寒条件下无法生存）。
The US government balked, but gave in when the Mexican government started erecting barriers to US corn.	美国政府还想拒绝，但当墨西哥政府开始设立壁垒抵制美国玉米时，美方让步了。
Imports from Mexico in the 2005–2006 season exceeded 130,000 metric tons (143,300 short tons; 127,900 long tons).	2005 年至 2006 年应季期间，从墨西哥进口到美国的鳄梨超过 13 万公吨（143300 短吨，127900 长吨）。
A computer mouse is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.	电脑鼠标是一种手持式指向设备，可以检测出相对于某个平面的二维移动。
This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface.	这种移动通常会转换成指针在显示屏上的运动，让用户得以流畅地控制图形用户界面。
The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968.	鼠标控制计算机系统的首次公开展示发生在 1968 年。
Originally wired to a computer, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.	早期的鼠标是用电线连接到电脑上的，而现在，很多鼠标都是无线鼠标，依靠近程无线电通讯与系统进行连接。
Mice originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, but modern mice often have optical sensors that have no moving parts.	早期的鼠标利用一个球在桌面上滚动以侦测移动，但现在的鼠标通常利用光感测器，不再设活动部件。
In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and "wheels", which enable additional control and dimensional input.	除了可以移动光标之外，电脑鼠标还有一个或一个以上的按键，利用按键可以在显示屏上进行菜单项选择等操作。鼠标通常还有其他元素，比如利用接触面和“轮子”可以进行额外的控制输入和额外的维度输入。
The earliest known publication of the term mouse as referring to a computer pointing device is in Bill English's July 1965 publication, "Computer-Aided Display Control" likely originating from its resemblance to the shape and size of a mouse, a rodent, with the cord resembling its tail.	已知最早公开利用“鼠标”一词来指代电脑指向设备的人是 Bill English，他 1965 年 7 月发表的一篇文章中第一次提到这个词。以“鼠标”取代“计算机辅助显示控制器”，可能是由于这种连着一根像尾巴一样的连线的设备在形状和大小方面都很像老鼠这种啮齿动物。
The plural for the small rodent is always "mice" in modern usage.	在现代的用法中，"mouse（老鼠）"这种小型啮齿动物的复数一直是“mice”。
The plural of a computer mouse is either "mouses" or "mice" according to most dictionaries, with "mice" being more common.	根据大多数词典，电脑鼠标的复数形式是“mouses”或“mice”，其中“mice”更为常见。
The first recorded plural usage is "mice"; the online Oxford Dictionaries cites a 1984 use, and earlier uses include J. C. R.	据记载，史上第一次表达鼠标复数用的是“mice”。在线牛津字典引用的是 1984 年的一个用法，更早之前的用法包括
Licklider's "The Computer as a Communication Device" of 1968.	J.C.R Licklider 1968 年发表的文章《The Computer as a Communication Device》中的用法。
The term computer mouses may be used informally in some cases.	非正式情况下可能会用“mouses”来表示电脑鼠标的复数。
Although, the plural of mouse (small rodent) is mice, the two words have undergone a differentiation through usage.	虽然"mouse（小型啮齿动物）"的复数是"mice"，但这两个词在使用过程中出现了一些差异化。
The trackball, a related pointing device, was invented in 1946 by Ralph Benjamin as part of a post-World War II-era fire-control radar plotting system called Comprehensive Display System (CDS).	轨迹球也是一种相关的指向设备，1946 年，拉尔夫·本杰明发明了轨迹球，当时是用在二战后的一种叫“综合显示系统（CDS）”的火控雷达绘图系统上。
Benjamin was then working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service.	本杰明当时供职于英国皇家海军科技部。
Benjamin's project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick.	当时本杰明的项目是利用模拟计算机，以用户通过操纵杆传来的几个初始输入点为基础，来计算出目标飞机将要飞过的位置。
Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented what they called a "roller ball" for this purpose.	本杰明觉得需要把输入设备做得更雅观一点，于是便发明了一种叫做“滚动球”的设备。
The device was patented in 1947, but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built, and the device was kept as a military secret.	该设备于 1947 年获得专利，但当时还只是一个原型，只是用一个金属球在两个有橡胶涂层的轮子上滚动，而且当时属于军事机密。
Another early trackball was built by Kenyon Taylor, a British electrical engineer working in collaboration with Tom Cranston and Fred Longstaff.	早期还有一种轨迹球，是英国电气工程师肯扬·泰勒与汤姆·克兰斯顿、弗雷德·郎斯塔夫二人联合发明的。
Taylor was part of the original Ferranti Canada, working on the Royal Canadian Navy's DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving) system in 1952.	泰勒是早期的加拿大公司 Ferranti 中的一员，1952 年参与了加拿大皇家海军的数字自动跟踪与解决（DATAR）系统的开发工作。
DATAR was similar in concept to Benjamin's display.	DATAR 在概念上与本杰明的轨迹球相差无几。
The trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions.	轨迹球用四个圆盘来获取运动，X 方向、 Y 方向各两个。
Several rollers provided mechanical support.	有几个滚轮来提供机械支撑。
When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball.	当球滚动时，负责获取运动的圆盘会旋转，其外缘的接触点会与金属丝进行周期性的接触，球每滚动一次，都会产生脉冲输出。
By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined.	通过计算脉冲，就可以确定球的物理运动。
A digital computer calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse-code modulation radio signals.	数字计算机会计算出球的轨迹，并利用脉冲电码调制的无线电信号将数据结果发送给同一行动组中的其他船只。
This trackball used a standard Canadian five-pin bowling ball.	轨迹球上面的球用的是标准的加拿大五针保龄球。
It was not patented, since it was a secret military project.	由于当时这个项目属于军事机密，因此没有申请专利。
Douglas Engelbart of the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) has been credited in published books by Thierry Bardini, Paul Ceruzzi, Howard Rheingold, and several others as the inventor of the computer mouse.	蒂埃里·巴蒂尼、保罗·库鲁兹以及霍华德·莱茵戈尔德三人在其发表的书籍中，将斯坦福研究所（今 SRI 国际）的道格拉斯·恩格尔巴特誉为鼠标之父。
Engelbart was also recognized as such in various obituary titles after his death in July 2013.	恩格尔巴特 2013 年去世时，各种讣告的标题也是这样写的。
By 1963, Engelbart had already established a research lab at SRI, the Augmentation Research Center (ARC), to pursue his objective of developing both hardware and software computer technology to "augment" human intelligence.	到 1963 年，恩格尔巴特已经在 SRI 建立起一个研究实验室：增智研究中心（ARC），目标是开发计算机的硬件和软件技术来“增强”人类智能。
That November, while attending a conference on computer graphics in Reno, Nevada, Engelbart began to ponder how to adapt the underlying principles of the planimeter to X-Y coordinate input.	同年 11 月，在内华达州里诺市参加计算机图形会议时，恩格尔巴特开始思考如何将测面仪的基本原理应用于 X-Y 坐标系的坐标输入。
On November 14, 1963, he first recorded his thoughts in his personal notebook about something he initially called a "bug," which in a "3-point" form could have a "drop point and 2 orthogonal wheels." He wrote that the "bug" would be "easier" and "more natural" to use, and unlike a stylus, it would stay still when let go, which meant it would be "much better for coordination with the keyboard."	1963 年 11 月 14 日，恩格尔巴特在个人笔记本上首次记录下他的想法，一开始他起名叫“虫子”，这个“虫子”是 3 点一体的，“有一个落点和两个正交的轮子”。他写到，这个“虫子”使用起来会“更容易”，“更自然”，而且和触控笔不一样的是，“虫子”松开时也不会滑走，这意味着它“可以与键盘很好地协调在一起”。
In 1964, Bill English joined ARC, where he helped Engelbart build the first mouse prototype.	1964, 比尔·英格利加入 ARC, 与恩格尔巴特一起开发了第一个鼠标原型。
They christened the device the mouse as early models had a cord attached to the rear part of the device which looked like a tail, and in turn resembled the common mouse.	他们将这种设备命名为鼠标，因为早期的模型末端连着一根线，看起来像一条尾巴，使得该设备看上去像一只常见的老鼠。
As noted above, this "mouse" was first mentioned in print in a July 1965 report, on which English was the lead author.	如前面所述，“鼠标”一词于1965 年 7 月在一份报告中被首次提到，而英格利是这份报告的第一作者。
On 9 December 1968, Engelbart publicly demonstrated the mouse at what would come to be known as The Mother of All Demos.	1968 年 12 月 9 日，恩格尔巴特在一场展示会议会中公开展示了鼠标，这场展示会后来被人们称为“所有展示之母”。
Engelbart never received any royalties for it, as his employer SRI held the patent, which expired before the mouse became widely used in personal computers.	恩格尔巴特从未因此获得任何版税，因为该专利的拥有者是他的雇主斯坦福研究院，专利过期之后，鼠标才被广泛用应用在个人电脑上。
In any event, the invention of the mouse was just a small part of Engelbart's much larger project of augmenting human intellect.	不管怎样，鼠标的发明只是恩格尔巴特增强人类智能计划中很小的一部分，他的计划远不止于此。
Several other experimental pointing-devices developed for Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS) exploited different body movements – for example, head-mounted devices attached to the chin or nose – but ultimately the mouse won out because of its speed and convenience.	恩格尔巴特还为他的 NLS 系统试验性发明了几款利用到其他不同的身体动作的指向设备——例如，连接到下巴或鼻子上的头戴装置——但最终鼠标以速度和便利性胜出。
The first mouse, a bulky device (pictured) used two potentiometers perpendicular to each other and connected to wheels: the rotation of each wheel translated into motion along one axis.	第一台鼠标是一种笨重的设备（如图所示），两个相互垂直的电位器被连接到轮子上，每个轮子的转动都会转化为沿着某个轴的运动。
At the time of the "Mother of All Demos", Engelbart's group had been using their second generation, 3-button mouse for about a year.	至召开“展示之母”大会时，恩格尔巴特团队已经使用他们的第二代鼠标（即三键鼠标）大概有一年了。
On October 2, 1968, a mouse device named Rollkugel (German for "rolling ball") was described as an optional device for its SIG-100 terminal was developed by the German company Telefunken.	1968 年 10 月 2 日，德国 Telefunken 公司开发了一种叫做 Rollkugel （德语中“滚动球”的意思）的鼠标设备，据该公司描述，Rollkugel 是作为其终端 SIG-100 的可选设备而开发的。
As the name suggests and unlike Engelbart's mouse, the Telefunken model already had a ball.	这个名字意味着，Telefunken 这款鼠标和恩格尔巴特的不同，它已经有一个球。
It was based on an earlier trackball-like device (also named Rollkugel) that was embedded into radar flight control desks.	它是基于早期嵌进雷达飞行控制台中的一种轨迹球式的设备（也叫Rollkugel）而制作的。
This trackball had been developed by a team led by Rainer Mallebrein at Telefunken Konstanz for the German Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung (Federal Air Traffic Control) as part of their TR 86 process computer system with its SIG 100-86 vector graphics terminal.	这种轨迹球是Telefunken Konstanz 公司的Rainer Mallebrein 牵头研发的，以作为德国联邦航空交通控制研究所的 TR 86 过程计算机系统的一部分， 这种计算机系统的终端支持 SIG 100-86 矢量图形。
When the development for the Telefunken main frame TR 440 began in 1965, Mallebrein and his team came up with the idea of "reversing" the existing Rollkugel into a moveable mouse-like device, so that customers did not have to be bothered with mounting holes for the earlier trackball device.	1965 年开始着手开发 Telefunken 的主框架 TR 440 时, Mallebrein 和他的团队想出了一个主意：将现有的 Rollkugel “逆过来用”，变成一个可移动的鼠标式设备，这样客户在使用早期的轨迹球时就不必为安装孔而烦恼。
Together with light pens and trackballs, it was offered as an optional input device for their system since 1968.	这种鼠标设备与光笔、轨迹球一道，自 1968 年起就开始作为他们系统的可选输入设备为他们所用。
Some Rollkugel mouses installed at the Leibniz-Rechenzentrum in Munich in 1972 are well preserved in a museum.	1972 年在德国慕尼黑莱布尼茨超级计算中心组装的一些 Rollkugel 鼠标，至今仍然完好地保存在博物馆里。
Telefunken considered the invention too unimportant to apply for a patent on it.	Telefunken 公司认为这一发明无足轻重，因此没有申请专利。
The Xerox Alto was one of the first computers designed for individual use in 1973 and is regarded as the first modern computer to utilize a mouse.	1973 年设计的 Xerox Alto 是最早的一批个人计算机之一，被认为是第一台使用了鼠标的现代计算机。
Inspired by PARC's Alto, the Lilith, a computer which had been developed by a team around Niklaus Wirth at ETH Zürich between 1978 and 1980, provided a mouse as well.	受到帕洛阿尔托研究中心的启发，苏黎世联邦理工学院的尼克劳斯·沃斯团队 1978 至 1980 年间开发的 Lilith 电脑也是配鼠标的。
The third marketed version of an integrated mouse shipped as a part of a computer and intended for personal computer navigation came with the Xerox 8010 Star in 1981.	第三款上市的整合式鼠标是作为电脑的一部分一起出售的，目的是用于个人电脑导航，并随着 1981 年施乐 8010 star 电脑的问世而问世。
By 1982, the Xerox 8010 was probably the best-known computer with a mouse.	到 1982，施乐 8010 可能已经成为当时最有名的带鼠标电脑。
The Sun-1 also came with a mouse, and the forthcoming Apple Lisa was rumored to use one, but the peripheral remained obscure; Jack Hawley of The Mouse House reported that one buyer for a large organization believed at first that his company sold lab mice.	Sun-1 也配备了鼠标，当时即将上市的苹果 Lisa 电脑据说也会配鼠标，但人们对该外设的概念仍然很模糊。Mouse House 公司的杰克·霍利表示，某大型公司的一名买家起初还以为他们公司是卖实验小白鼠的。
Hawley, who manufactured mice for Xerox, stated that "Practically, I have the market all to myself right now"; a Hawley mouse cost $415.	为施乐公司生产鼠标的霍利说：“实际上我现在在独享整个市场。”一款霍利鼠标的售价是 415 美元。
In 1982, Logitech introduced the P4 Mouse at the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas, its first hardware mouse.	1982 年，罗技公司在拉斯维加斯的 Comdex 贸易展上展示了 P4 鼠标，这是该公司生产的第一款硬件鼠标。
That same year Microsoft made the decision to make the MS-DOS program Microsoft Word mouse-compatible, and developed the first PC-compatible mouse.	同年，微软公司决定将其 MS-DOS 系统的程序 Microsoft Word 制作成可兼容鼠标的版本，并开发出了第一款与个人电脑兼容的鼠标。
Microsoft's mouse shipped in 1983, thus beginning the Microsoft Hardware division of the company.	1983年，微软的鼠标产品上市，从此微软变成了一家软硬件兼修的公司。
However, the mouse remained relatively obscure until the appearance of the Macintosh 128K (which included an updated version of the Lisa Mouse) in 1984, and of the Amiga 1000 and the Atari ST in 1985.	然而，人们对鼠标的概念还是相对模糊，直到 1984 年苹果 Macintosh 128K （该电脑包含一个更新版本的 Lisa 鼠标）的问世以及1985年Amiga 1000、 Atari ST 的出现。
Other uses of the mouse's input occur commonly in special application-domains.	其他利用鼠标进行输入的情况通常出现在特殊应用领域。
In interactive three-dimensional graphics, the mouse's motion often translates directly into changes in the virtual objects' or camera's orientation.	在交互式三维图形中，鼠标的运动通常直接转换成虚拟物体或摄像头的方位变化。
For example, in the first-person shooter genre of games (see below), players usually employ the mouse to control the direction in which the virtual player's "head" faces: moving the mouse up will cause the player to look up, revealing the view above the player's head.	例如，在第一人称射击类游戏（见下文）中，玩家通常会使用鼠标来控制虚拟角色的“头部”所朝向的方向：向上移动鼠标会让角色抬起头，露出角色头部上方的视角。
A related function makes an image of an object rotate, so that all sides can be examined.	某个与之相关的功能会使物体的图像转动，这样就可以看到物体的每一面。
3D design and animation software often modally chords many different combinations to allow objects and cameras to be rotated and moved through space with the few axes of movement mice can detect.	3D 设计和动画软件通常会以模式化的方式串起许多不同的组合，这样物体和摄像头就可以旋转并在鼠标仅能检测到的几个行动轴线的空间内移动。
When mice have more than one button, the software may assign different functions to each button.	当鼠标有多个按键时，软件可能会为每个按键分配不同的功能。
Often, the primary (leftmost in a right-handed configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (rightmost in a right-handed) button will bring up a menu of alternative actions applicable to that item.	通常，鼠标上的主要按键（右手版鼠标最左边的按键）用来选择一项内容，而次要按键（右手版鼠标最右边的按键）用来弹出一个菜单，显示该选项还有哪些可选操作。
For example, on platforms with more than one button, the Mozilla web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new tab or window in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.	例如，在有多个按键的鼠标上点击第一个按键时，Mizilla 浏览器会接入一个链接，点击第二个按键时，会弹出一个与该语境相关的菜单，显示该链接的可选操作。点击第三个按键（中间键）时，通常会在新的标签页或窗口打开该链接。
Optical mice rely entirely on one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and an imaging array of photodiodes to detect movement relative to the underlying surface, eschewing the internal moving parts a mechanical mouse uses in addition to its optics.	光电鼠标完全依靠一个或多个发光二极管（LEDs）、一个光电二极管成像阵列来检测相对于鼠标底面的运动，从而避免了在光电的基础上加上机械鼠标那样的内置活动部件。
A laser mouse is an optical mouse that uses coherent (laser) light.	激光鼠标也是光电鼠标，只不过利用的是相干光（激光）。
The earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces, whereas the modern LED optical mouse works on most opaque diffuse surfaces; it is usually unable to detect movement on specular surfaces like polished stone.	最早的光电鼠标是在预先印妥的鼠标垫表面来探测鼠标的移动的，而现代的 LED 光电鼠标则多数在不透明的漫反射面上工作。这种鼠标通常无法探测出单向反射面上的移动，比如抛光石。
Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision, improving performance on opaque specular surfaces.	利用激光二极管还可以获得更高的分辨率和的精准度，从而可以更好地在不透明单向反射面上使用。
Battery powered, wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.	无线光电鼠标由电池供电，其 LED 灯间歇性闪烁以减少耗电，只有在检测到移动时才会持续发光。
Often called "air mice" since they do not require a surface to operate, inertial mice use a tuning fork or other accelerometer (US Patent 4787051) to detect rotary movement for every axis supported.	惯性鼠标通常被称为“空气鼠标”，因为这种鼠标不放在一个表面上也能操作。惯性鼠标利用音叉或其他加速度计（美国专利 4787051）来检测每一个所支持的轴的转动动作。
The most common models (manufactured by Logitech and Gyration) work using 2 degrees of rotational freedom and are insensitive to spatial translation.	最常见的模型（由罗技公司和 Gyration 公司制造）利用两个度的旋转自由度来工作，对空间平移不敏感。
The user requires only small wrist rotations to move the cursor, reducing user fatigue or "gorilla arm".	用户只需稍微转动一下手腕就能移动光标，从而减少了用户疲劳，避免“麒麟臂”。
Usually cordless, they often have a switch to deactivate the movement circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position.	这种鼠标一般都是无线的，通常有一个开关，不用的时候可以关闭活动电路，这样用户就可以动来动去而不会影响到光标位置。
A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased ease-of-use.	某惯性鼠标的专利描述中表示，这种鼠标相比光电鼠标耗能更少，灵敏度更高，重量更轻，操作更加简单。
In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture.	惯性鼠标与无线键盘的结合提供了符合人体工学的其他选择，因为这样的安排无需平坦的工作桌面也能工作，从而潜在地缓解了工作中与姿势有关的一些重复性动作损伤。
Also known as bats, flying mice, or wands, these devices generally function through ultrasound and provide at least three degrees of freedom.	这种设备也被称为“蝙蝠鼠标”、“飞鼠鼠标”、“魔杖鼠标”，通常通过超声波发挥作用，支持至少三个度的旋转自由。
Probably the best known example would be 3Dconnexion ("Logitech's SpaceMouse") from the early 1990s.	最著名的例子大概是 20 世纪 90 年代初的 3Dconnexion 鼠标 (“罗技的太空鼠标”) 。
In the late 1990s Kantek introduced the 3D RingMouse.	20 世纪 90 年代末，Kantek 推出了 3D 指环鼠标。
This wireless mouse was worn on a ring around a finger, which enabled the thumb to access three buttons.	这款鼠标使用时手指套在一个环内，利用拇指来控制三个按键。
The mouse was tracked in three dimensions by a base station.	这种鼠标由一个基站来对其进行三个维度上的跟踪。
Despite a certain appeal, it was finally discontinued because it did not provide sufficient resolution.	这种鼠标虽然有一定的呼声，但终究没能走入市场，因为它无法完全解决人们的需求。
One example of a 2000s consumer 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote.	21世纪初市面上的 3D 指向设备的其中一个例子是 Wii Remote。
While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation).	Wii Remote 主要用作动作感应设备（也就是说，它可以确定动作的方位和方向），但也可以利用与之一体的红外摄像头（由于该双截棍手柄没有摄像头，只能测得当前的朝向和方位），通过对比红外发射器所发出的光的距离和位置，来测出空间位置。
The obvious drawback to this approach is that it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar.	这种方法的明显缺陷是其摄像头可以看到感应条但只能生成空间坐标。
More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system.	自此之后，市场上推出了更加精确的设备，包括 PlayStation Move、Razer Hydra 以及 HTC Vive虚拟现实系统的控制器部分。
All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.	这些装置都可以准确侦测出三维空间中的位置和方向，不管其相对于感应站是什么角度。
A mouse-related controller called the SpaceBall has a ball placed above the work surface that can easily be gripped.	一款与鼠标相关的控制器叫 SpaceBall，有一个置于工作台上的圆球，很容易抓握。
With spring-loaded centering, it sends both translational as well as angular displacements on all six axes, in both directions for each.	其中心位置以弹簧支承，可以感应所有六个轴上每一个轴的的平移和角位移两种位移方向。
In November 2010 a German Company called Axsotic introduced a new concept of 3D mouse called 3D Spheric Mouse.	2010 年 11 月，一家名为 Axsotic 的德国公司推出了一款叫“ 3D 球面鼠标”的新概念 3D 鼠标。
This new concept of a true six degree-of-freedom input device uses a ball to rotate in 3 axes without any limitations.	这款新概念鼠标是一款真正的六自由度输入设备，使用一个球在三个轴内自由转动，不受任何限制。
In 2000, Logitech introduced a "tactile mouse" that contained a small actuator to make the mouse vibrate.	2000 年，罗技公司推出了一款“触觉鼠标”，内含一个小致动器，可以使鼠标振动。
Such a mouse can augment user-interfaces with haptic feedback, such as giving feedback when crossing a window boundary.	此款鼠标可以通过触觉反馈更好地增强用户界面的使用效果，例如在越过窗口边界时鼠标会提供反馈。
To surf by touch requires the user to be able to feel depth or hardness; this ability was realized with the first electrorheological tactile mice but never marketed.	以触摸的方式来上网要求用户必须能够感觉到深度和硬度，这种能力曾在第一款电流变触觉鼠标上实现过，但该款鼠标一直没有上市。
Tablet digitizers are sometimes used with accessories called pucks, devices which rely on absolute positioning, but can be configured for sufficiently mouse-like relative tracking that they are sometimes marketed as mice.	平板数字化设备有时会与一种叫做 pucks 的配件一起使用，这种设备依赖于绝对定位，但也可以配置成完全类似于鼠标那样的相对跟踪，因此这种设备有时会被当作鼠标出售。
As the name suggests, this type of mouse is intended to provide optimum comfort and avoid injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis and other repetitive strain injuries.	顾名思义，这种鼠标旨在提供最佳舒适感，使用户免受腕管综合症、关节炎等重复性劳损疾病的伤害。
It is designed to fit natural hand position and movements, to reduce discomfort.	它顺应手部的自然位置和动作而设计，能够减轻使用时的不适。
