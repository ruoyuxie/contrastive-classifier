Although software testing can determine the correctness of software under the assumption of some specific hypotheses (see the hierarchy of testing difficulty below), testing cannot identify all the defects within the software.	儘管軟體測試能夠在針對某些特定假設的預設情況下判定軟體的正確性 (請見下方的測試難度層級)，但仍舊無法識別出軟體內的所有缺陷。
Instead, it furnishes a criticism or comparison that compares the state and behavior of the product against test oracles—principles or mechanisms by which someone might recognize a problem.	軟體測試反而會針對測試判定準則 (可用來找出問題的原則或機制) 比較產品的狀態及行為，或是提出評論。
These oracles may include (but are not limited to) specifications, contracts, comparable products, past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose, user or customer expectations, relevant standards, applicable laws, or other criteria.	這些判定準則可包含 (但不限於) 規格、契約、可相互比較的產品、同一項產品的過往版本、關於預定或預期目的的推論、使用者或客戶的期望、相關標準、適用法規或是其他準則。
A primary purpose of testing is to detect software failures so that defects may be discovered and corrected.	測試的主要目的在於偵測出軟體錯誤，以便找出並修正缺陷。
Testing cannot establish that a product functions properly under all conditions, but only that it does not function properly under specific conditions.	測試並無法確保產品能在所有環境條件下正常運作，僅能確知產品會在特定的環境條件下無法正常運作。
The scope of software testing often includes the examination of code as well as the execution of that code in various environments and conditions as well as examining the aspects of code: does it do what it is supposed to do and do what it needs to do.	軟體測試的範圍通常會包括程式碼檢測與檢驗該程式碼在各種環境和條件下的執行情況，以及檢驗程式碼的各個層面：其是否能做到該做且必須做到的事項。
In the current culture of software development, a testing organization may be separate from the development team.	在目前的軟體研發文化中，專責測試的組織會和研發團隊區分開來。
There are various roles for testing team members.	測試團隊的成員身兼多職。
Information derived from software testing may be used to correct the process by which software is developed.	經由軟體測試取得的資訊可用來修正軟體的研發過程。
Every software product has a target audience.	每一項軟體產品都有各自的目標受眾。
For example, the audience for video game software is completely different from banking software.	例如，電玩遊戲的受眾就和銀行軟體的受眾截然不同。
Therefore, when an organization develops or otherwise invests in a software product, it can assess whether the software product will be acceptable to its end users, its target audience, its purchasers and other stakeholders.	因此，組織能夠在研發或投資軟體產品時，評估其終端使用者、目標受眾、購買者和其他利害關係人是否能接受該項軟體產品。
Software testing aids the process of attempting to make this assessment.	軟體測試能在嘗試完成評估的過程中助上一臂之力。
Not all software defects are caused by coding errors.	並非所有軟體缺陷都是因程式碼錯誤所導致。
One common source of expensive defects is requirement gaps, i.e., unrecognized requirements that result in errors of omission by the program designer.	其中一個常見且代價昂貴的缺陷根源為需求差異，即程式設計者並未注意到且導致不慎省略掉的需求。
Requirement gaps can often be non-functional requirements such as testability, scalability, maintainability, performance, and security.	會產生差異的需求通常是非功能性需求，例如可測試性、可擴展性、可維護性、效能表現和安全性。
Software faults occur through the following processes.	軟體故障會透過下列程序發生。
A programmer makes an error (mistake), which results in a defect (fault, bug) in the software source code.	程式設計師有所疏失 (犯錯)，導致軟體的原始碼出現缺陷 (故障、漏洞)。
If this defect is executed, in certain situations the system will produce wrong results, causing a failure.	如果系統執行了這項缺陷，就會在某些狀況下產生錯誤結果，導致故障失常。
Not all defects will necessarily result in failures.	並非所有缺陷一定都會導致故障失常。
For example, defects in the dead code will never result in failures.	例如在無作用的程式碼中的缺陷就不會導致故障失常。
A defect can turn into a failure when the environment is changed.	當環境有所變動時，缺陷可能就會造成故障失常。
Examples of these changes in environment include the software being run on a new computer hardware platform, alterations in source data, or interacting with different software.	環境變動的例子包括在新的電腦硬體平台上執行軟體、原始資料有所改變，或是與不同的軟體產生互動。
A single defect may result in a wide range of failure symptoms.	單一缺陷可能會導致各種不同的故障徵兆。
A fundamental problem with software testing is that testing under all combinations of inputs and preconditions (initial state) is not feasible, even with a simple product.	軟體測試有個根本問題為無法實際結合各種輸入內容及前置條件 (初始狀態) 來進行測試，即便是簡單的產品也難以實行。
This means that the number of defects in a software product can be very large and defects that occur infrequently are difficult to find in testing.	這表示軟體產品中的缺陷數量可能極為龐大，且難以透過測試找出並未經常發生的缺陷。
More significantly, non-functional dimensions of quality (how it is supposed to be versus what it is supposed to do)—usability, scalability, performance, compatibility, reliability—can be highly subjective; something that constitutes sufficient value to one person may be intolerable to another.	其中更為顯著的是，諸如可用性、可擴展性、效能表現、可相容性、可靠性等非功能性的品質構面 (預期樣貌相對於預期功能) 可能具有高度主觀差異—讓某人認為具有充分價值的事物，可能會讓另一個人感到難以忍受。
Software developers can't test everything, but they can use combinatorial test design to identify the minimum number of tests needed to get the coverage they want.	軟體研發人員無法測試完所有項目，但是他們可以使用組合測試設計來確認達到預期覆蓋範圍所需的最少測試次數。
Combinatorial test design enables users to get greater test coverage with fewer tests.	組合測試設計能讓使用者得以透過更少的測試次數達到更為寬廣的測試覆蓋範圍。
Whether they are looking for speed or test depth, they can use combinatorial test design methods to build structured variation into their test cases.	無論他們是要尋求速戰速決或是要測試深度，都可以在他們的測試案例中使用組合測試設計方式來打造出結構完整的變體。
A study conducted by NIST in 2002 reports that software bugs cost the U.S. economy $59.5 billion annually.	據美國國家標準暨技術研究院於 2002 年進行的研究報告指出，軟體漏洞每年在美國耗費了 595 億美元的經濟收入。
More than a third of this cost could be avoided, if better software testing was performed.	如果能執行更優質的軟體測試，就能免除超過三分之一的開銷。
Outsourcing software testing because of costs is very common, with China, the Philippines and India being preferred destinations.	為了節省開銷而將軟體測試外包的情形十分常見，中國、菲律賓和印度均為首選目的地。
Software testing can be done by dedicated software testers.	軟體測試可交由技巧嫻熟的軟體測試人員來進行。
Until the 1980s, the term "software tester" was used generally, but later it was also seen as a separate profession.	直到 1980 年代，「軟體測試人員」一詞曾被廣泛使用，不過後來也被當成一項獨立職業。
Regarding the periods and the different goals in software testing, different roles have been established, such as test manager, test lead, test analyst, test designer, tester, automation developer, and test administrator.	考量到軟體測試過程中的不同階段和目標，不同的的職務角色應運而生，例如測試經理、測試主管、測試分析師、測試設計師、測試人員、自動化研發人員及測試管理員等。
Software testing can also be performed by non-dedicated software testers.	軟體測試也可以交由非專職的軟體測試人員來執行。
Glenford J. Myers initially introduced the separation of debugging from testing in 1979.	Glenford J. Myers 於 1979 年初次將除錯和測試區分開來。
Although his attention was on breakage testing ("A successful test case is one that detects an as-yet undiscovered error.") it illustrated the desire of the software engineering community to separate fundamental development activities, such as debugging, from that of verification.	儘管當初他是將注意力放在破損測試上 (「能偵測到尚未發現到的錯誤，才稱得上是成功的測試。」)，卻也說明了當時的軟體工程師社群有意將基礎軟體開發活動 (比如除錯) 與驗證區分開來。
There are many approaches available in software testing.	軟體測試有許多方法可以使用。
Reviews, walkthroughs, or inspections are referred to as static testing, whereas executing programmed code with a given set of test cases is referred to as dynamic testing.	審查 (review)、逐步審視 (walkthrough) 或檢查 (inspection) 所指的都是靜態測試，透過既定組合的測試用例來執行程式碼則為動態測試。
Dynamic testing takes place when the program itself is run.	動態測試會在程式執行時進行。
Dynamic testing may begin before the program is 100% complete in order to test particular sections of code and are applied to discrete functions or modules.	動態測試可在程式百分之百編撰完成之前開始進行，藉此測試程式碼的特定區段以及套用到離散函數或模組的情形。
Typical techniques for these are either using stubs/drivers or execution from a debugger environment.	一般而言，用來進行這類測試的技術莫過於使用存根/驅動程式或是在除錯工具的環境中執行。
Static testing involves verification, whereas dynamic testing also involves validation.	靜態測試包含了驗證程序，動態測試則包含了確認程序。
Passive testing means verifying the system behavior without any interaction with the software product.	被動測試即表示是在和軟體產品沒有任何互動的情形下驗證系統行為。
Contrary to active testing, testers do not provide any test data but look at system logs and traces.	與主動測試相反，測試人員不會提供任何測試資料，只會查看系統記錄檔和運行軌跡。
They mine for patterns and specific behavior in order to make some kind of decisions.	他們會探尋其模式及特定行為以便做出某種決策。
This is related to offline runtime verification and log analysis.	這與離線運行時間驗證和記錄檔分析相關。
Exploratory testing is an approach to software testing that is concisely described as simultaneous learning, test design and test execution.	探索式測試為軟體測試的其中一種方式，簡而言之即為同步學習、測試設計和測試執行。
Cem Kaner, who coined the term in 1984, defines exploratory testing as "a style of software testing that emphasizes the personal freedom and responsibility of the individual tester to continually optimize the quality of his/her work by treating test-related learning, test design, test execution, and test result interpretation as mutually supportive activities that run in parallel throughout the project."	Cem Kaner 於 1984 年創出「探索式測試」一詞，將其定義為「強調個別測試人員的個人自由度以及責任的軟體測試類別，藉由在測試專案進行的過程中同步探究與測試相關的學習、測試設計、測試執行及測試結果判讀，彼此相輔相成進而持續提升其軟體作業品質。」
Software testing methods are traditionally divided into white- and black-box testing.	傳統的軟體測試方法分為白箱測試和黑箱測試兩種。
These two approaches are used to describe the point of view that the tester takes when designing test cases.	這兩種方法分別形容了測試人員在設計測試用例時所採取的視角。
A hybrid approach called grey-box testing may also be applied to software testing methodology.	有一種名為灰箱測試的混合方法也會應用在軟體測試中。
With the concept of grey-box testing—which develops tests from specific design elements—gaining prominence, this "arbitrary distinction" between black- and white-box testing has faded somewhat.	隨著灰箱測試的概念 (藉由特定的設計元素發展出測試內容) 漸漸成為主流，將測試「武斷區別」為黑箱和白箱的作法也逐漸不為人所用。
Black-box testing (also known as functional testing) treats the software as a "black box," examining functionality without any knowledge of internal implementation, without seeing the source code.	黑箱測試 (也稱作功能性測試) 會將軟體當成一個「黑箱」，在完全不知道其內部實作細節的狀況下檢測其功能性，也不會查看其原始碼。
The testers are only aware of what the software is supposed to do, not how it does it.	測試人員只會注意該軟體理應有何功能，而非其如何運作。
Black-box testing methods include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all-pairs testing, state transition tables, decision table testing, fuzz testing, model-based testing, use case testing, exploratory testing, and specification-based testing.	黑箱測試方法內容包括：等價劃分、邊界值分析、全成對組合測試、狀態變遷表、決策表測試、模糊測試、模型測試、使用案例測試、探索式測試和規格測試。
Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality of software according to the applicable requirements.	規格測試的目標在於根據軟體適用的需求來測試其功能。
This level of testing usually requires thorough test cases to be provided to the tester, who then can simply verify that for a given input, the output value (or behavior), either "is" or "is not" the same as the expected value specified in the test case.	這一階層的測試需要將完整的測試用例提供給測試人員， 好讓他們可以直接就所給予的輸入內容驗證其輸出值 (或行為)，看看該值與測試用例中敘明的預期值「相同」或「相異」。
Test cases are built around specifications and requirements, i.e., what the application is supposed to do.	測試用例會依據規格及需求而創造，也就是指該應用程式理應具有的功能。
It uses external descriptions of the software, including specifications, requirements, and designs to derive test cases.	測試用例會依據軟體的外部描述 (包括規格、需求和設計) 來建構其內容。
These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional.	這些測試可以是功能性或是非功能性，但通常還是以功能性居多。
Specification-based testing may be necessary to assure correct functionality, but it is insufficient to guard against complex or high-risk situations.	規格測試也許在確保功能正確方面不可或缺，卻仍不足以防範複雜或高風險等情況。
One advantage of the black box technique is that no programming knowledge is required.	黑箱測試技術的一大優點在於它不需要程式編寫方面的知識。
Whatever biases the programmers may have had, the tester likely has a different set and may emphasize different areas of functionality.	無論程式設計師可能會有怎樣的偏誤成見，測試人員或許會有不同的思考模式，也可能會把重點方在不同的功能區塊。
On the other hand, black-box testing has been said to be "like a walk in a dark labyrinth without a flashlight." Because they do not examine the source code, there are situations when a tester writes many test cases to check something that could have been tested by only one test case or leaves some parts of the program untested.	儘管如此，黑箱測試向來被形容成是「走在黑漆漆的迷宮中，且不帶手電筒」。因為測試人員不會檢測原始碼，所以會出現測試人員編寫出許多測試用例來檢查原本只需要單一用例就能測試完的項目，或是遺漏了程式中某些尚未測試的部分等情況。
This method of test can be applied to all levels of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance.	這類測試方法可以應用在所有階層的軟體測試，如：單元、整合、系統和接受度。
It typically comprises most if not all testing at higher levels, but can also dominate unit testing as well.	一般而言，該類測試大多以高階測試為主，但也能夠主導單元測試。
Component interface testing	元件介面測試
Component interface testing is a variation of black-box testing, with the focus on the data values beyond just the related actions of a subsystem component.	元件介面測試為黑箱測試的變化版，重點僅放在子系統元件相關動作背後的資料數值上。
The practice of component interface testing can be used to check the handling of data passed between various units, or subsystem components, beyond full integration testing between those units.	元件介面測試可在不同單元之間的完整整合測試之外，實際用來檢查資料在不同單元或子系統間傳遞的處理情形。
The data being passed can be considered as "message packets" and the range or data types can be checked, for data generated from one unit, and tested for validity before being passed into another unit.	傳遞中的資料可稱為「訊息封包」，且可檢查從其中一個單元產生的資料型態範圍，以及在資料傳遞到另一個單元之前測試其效度。
One option for interface testing is to keep a separate log file of data items being passed, often with a timestamp logged to allow analysis of thousands of cases of data passed between units for days or weeks.	介面測試的其中一個選項為分別儲存各個傳遞資料項目的記錄檔，通常會附上時間戳記以便分析在數天或數週內傳遞的上千筆資料實例。
Tests can include checking the handling of some extreme data values while other interface variables are passed as normal values.	測試內容可包括檢查某些極端資料值在系統將其它介面變數當成標準值傳遞時的處理情形。
Unusual data values in an interface can help explain unexpected performance in the next unit.	介面中不尋常的資料值可協助解釋下一個單元未如預期的效能表現。
The aim of visual testing is to provide developers with the ability to examine what was happening at the point of software failure by presenting the data in such a way that the developer can easily find the information she or he requires, and the information is expressed clearly.	目視檢測的目標在於讓開發人員得以在軟體發生故障當下，透過呈現內容清楚明瞭的資料來輕鬆找到他/她所需的資訊。
At the core of visual testing is the idea that showing someone a problem (or a test failure), rather than just describing it, greatly increases clarity and understanding.	目視檢測的核心想法為讓對方直接看見問題 (或是測試失敗) 而非只是形容問題，可大幅增進其明確及理解程度。
Visual testing, therefore, requires the recording of the entire test process – capturing everything that occurs on the test system in video format.	因此，目視檢測需要將完整的測試過程記錄下來，以影片格式捕捉在測試系統上發生的一切狀況。
Output videos are supplemented by real-time tester input via picture-in-a-picture webcam and audio commentary from microphones.	輸出的影片會輔以子母畫面實時記錄測試人員的輸入過程，以及透過麥克風記錄的評論音訊內容。
Visual testing provides a number of advantages.	目視檢測有諸多優點。
The quality of communication is increased drastically because testers can show the problem (and the events leading up to it) to the developer as opposed to just describing it and the need to replicate test failures will cease to exist in many cases.	因為測試人員可以直接讓開發人員看見問題 (以及造成問題的事件緣由)，所以相對於只形容問題本身，溝通的品質會急遽增長，而且在許多案例當中將不再需要重建測試失敗的過程。
The developer will have all the evidence she or he requires of a test failure and can instead focus on the cause of the fault and how it should be fixed.	開發人員會得到所有他/她需要用來釐清測試失敗的證據，能夠轉而將重點放在其中的因果關係以及如何修正問題。
Ad hoc testing and exploratory testing are important methodologies for checking software integrity, because they require less preparation time to implement, while the important bugs can be found quickly.	隨機測試和探索式測試為用來檢查軟體完整性的重要方法，因為這兩種測試方法在實作上需要的準備時間較短，可快速找到重大漏洞。
In ad hoc testing, where testing takes place in an improvised, impromptu way, the ability of the tester(s) to base testing off documented methods and then improvise variations of those tests can result in more rigorous examination of defect fixes.	隨機測試會以不按牌理出牌的方式進行測試，測試人員能夠使用非經明文規定的測試方法，然後那些隨興變化而出的測試可以讓之後的缺陷修正檢驗更加嚴謹。
However, unless strict documentation of the procedures are maintained, one of the limits of ad hoc testing is lack of repeatability.	然而，除非整體流程有用文字詳細記錄下來，否則難以重複進行會是隨機測試的一大限制。
Grey-box testing (American spelling: gray-box testing) involves having knowledge of internal data structures and algorithms for purposes of designing tests while executing those tests at the user, or black-box level.	灰箱測試包括為了設計測試內容了解內部資料結構及演算法，同時於使用者端或黑箱階層執行測試。
The tester will often have access to both "the source code and the executable binary." Grey-box testing may also include reverse engineering (using dynamic code analysis) to determine, for instance, boundary values or error messages.	測試人員通常能夠存取「原始碼及可執行的二進位制檔案」。灰箱測試可能也會包括透過逆向工程 (使用動態程式碼分析) 來加以判定，例如判定邊界值或錯誤訊息。
Manipulating input data and formatting output do not qualify as grey-box, as the input and output are clearly outside of the "black box" that we are calling the system under test.	操作輸入資料與編排輸出格式並不足以稱為灰箱測試，因為其輸入及輸出內容均明顯位於我們稱之為「黑箱」的測試中系統之外。
This distinction is particularly important when conducting integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers, where only the interfaces are exposed for the test.	這樣的區別，在針對由兩位不同的開發人員編寫出來的兩組程式碼進行整合測試時尤為重要，因為在測試過程中僅會看見介面。
By knowing the underlying concepts of how the software works, the tester makes better-informed testing choices while testing the software from outside.	在了解了軟體運作的基本概念之後，測試人員可以在透過外觀測試軟體時做出更加明智的抉擇。
Typically, a grey-box tester will be permitted to set up an isolated testing environment with activities such as seeding a database.	一般而言，進行灰箱測試的測試人員有權為填充資料庫等動作設定一個獨立的測試環境。
The tester can observe the state of the product being tested after performing certain actions such as executing SQL statements against the database and then executing queries to ensure that the expected changes have been reflected.	測試人員可在進行某些特定動作 (如針對資料庫執行 SQL 陳述) 之後觀察產品的測試狀態，接著執行查詢以確保預期的變更已修改完成。
Grey-box testing implements intelligent test scenarios, based on limited information.	灰箱測試可根據有限的資訊實行智慧測試情境。
This will particularly apply to data type handling, exception handling, and so on.	這尤其可以應用在資料型態處理、例外處理...等等。
Broadly speaking, there are at least three levels of testing: unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.	概括而言，測試階層至少有三個：單元測試、整合測試及系統測試。
However, a fourth level, acceptance testing, may be included by developers.	然而，開發人員可能會納入接受度測試，列為第四階層。
This may be in the form of operational acceptance testing or be simple end-user (beta) testing, testing to ensure the software meets functional expectations.	其形式可能會是可操作的接受度測試或單純的終端使用者 (測試版) 測試，用來確保軟體符合功能方面的預期。
Tests are frequently grouped into one of these levels by where they are added in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test.	測試經常會依據在軟體開發過程中加入的時間點來劃分為其中一個階層，或是依據該項測試所指定的階層。
The first people to inhabit the area now known as Sydney were indigenous Australians having migrated from northern Australia and before that from southeast Asia.	第一批來到現今雪梨地區居住的先民為之前從東南亞地區遷徙至澳洲北部的澳洲原住民。
Radiocarbon dating suggests human activity first started to occur in the Sydney area from around 30,735 years ago.	據放射性碳定年法推測，雪梨地區出現的人類活動最早可追溯至約 30,735 年前。
However, numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Western Sydney's gravel sediments that were dated from 45,000 to 50,000 years BP, which would indicate that there was human settlement in Sydney earlier than thought.	然而，在雪梨西部的礫石沉積層中發現了許多原住民族的石製工具，年代推定為距今四萬五千年至五萬年前，這表示人類定居雪梨的時間遠比原先認為的還要久遠。
The first meeting between the native people and the British occurred on 29 April 1770 when Lieutenant James Cook landed at Botany Bay on the Kurnell Peninsula and encountered the Gweagal clan.	原住民族與英國人於 1770 年 4 月 29 日首次碰面，當時英國海軍上尉 James Cook 在科內爾半島 (Kurnell Peninsula) 的博特尼灣 (Botany Bay) 登陸，遇見了格威蓋爾 (Gweagal) 部族。
He noted in his journal that they were confused and somewhat hostile towards the foreign visitors.	他在自己的日誌中提到那些原住民看起來一臉困惑，而且對於外來訪客頗有敵意。
Cook was on a mission of exploration and was not commissioned to start a settlement.	Cook 當時肩負探索任務，並未受託在此建立根據地。
He spent a short time collecting food and conducting scientific observations before continuing further north along the east coast of Australia and claiming the new land he had discovered for Britain.	他花了一小段時間採集食物並進行科學觀察，接著繼續沿著澳洲東岸往北而行，然後宣告自己發現的這片新天地為英國屬地。
Prior to the arrival of the British there were 4,000 to 8,000 native people in Sydney from as many as 29 different clans.	在英國人抵達之前，雪梨當地有四千至八千名原住民，分屬多達二十九個不同部族。
The earliest British settlers called the natives Eora people.	最早在此定居的英國人稱呼當地的原住民為依奧拉 (Eora) 族人。
"Eora" is the term the indigenous population used to explain their origins upon first contact with the British.	「依奧拉」為原住民族在首次接觸到英國人時，用來解釋他們的先祖起源的詞彙。
Its literal meaning is "from this place".Sydney Cove from Port Jackson to Petersham was inhabited by the Cadigal clan.	直譯為「來自此處」之意。從雪梨灣的傑克森港到彼得漢這一帶地區，當初居住著卡地哥 (Cadigal) 部族。
The principal language groups were Darug, Guringai, and Dharawal.	主要使用的語言為達魯格語 (Darug)、古林凱語 (Gurigai) 及塔拉瓦爾語 (Dharawal)。
The earliest Europeans to visit the area noted that the indigenous people were conducting activities such as camping and fishing, using trees for bark and food, collecting shells, and cooking fish.	最早造訪此地的歐洲人曾提到當地的原住民族會進行野營及釣魚等活動，並且會採集樹皮和樹上的食物、捕撈貝類以及煮魚為食。
Britain—before that, England—and Ireland had for a long time been sending their convicts across the Atlantic to the American colonies.	英國 (早年稱為英格蘭) 和愛爾蘭曾經有很長一段時間會遠渡大西洋，將國內的受刑人運送到美洲的殖民地。
That trade was ended with the Declaration of Independence by the United States in 1776.	該運送受刑人的行為隨著美國於 1776 年發表《獨立宣言》而終止。
Britain decided in 1786 to found a new penal outpost in the territory discovered by Cook some 16 years earlier.	英國於 1786 年決定在 Cook 約莫 16 年前發現的領土另尋流放犯人之處。
Captain Philip led the First Fleet of 11 ships and about 850 convicts into Botany Bay on 18 January 1788, though deemed the location unsuitable due to poor soil and a lack of fresh water.	Philip 艦長於 1788 年 1 月 18 日率領第一艦隊共 11 艘船，載運了約 850 名受刑人來到博特尼灣，不過該地區因為土壤貧脊且欠缺淡水資源，並不適合流放犯人。
He travelled a short way further north and arrived at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788.	於是他往北邊續行了一小段路，於 1788 年 1 月 26 日抵達雪梨灣。
This was to be the location for the new colony.	這裡就此成為新殖民地的所在之處。
Phillip described Port Jackson as being "without exception the finest harbour in the world".	Philip 形容傑克森港為「無庸置疑的世界第一良港」。
The colony was at first to be titled "New Albion" (after Albion, another name for Great Britain), but Phillip decided on "Sydney".	該殖民地一開始以「新阿爾比恩」(New Albion) 為名 (阿爾比恩為當時大英帝國的代稱)，不過 Philip 後來決定命名為「雪梨」。
The official proclamation and naming of the colony happened on 7 February 1788.	其後於 1788 年 2 月 7 日由官方正式公告為殖民地的名稱。
Lieutenant William Dawes produced a town plan in 1790 but it was ignored by the colony's leaders.	海軍上尉 William Dawes 於 1790 年擬定了一份城鎮規劃，卻遭當時的殖民地領導團隊忽視。
Sydney's layout today reflects this lack of planning.	雪梨現今的都市配置樣貌顯見其缺乏規劃。
Between 1788 and 1792, 3,546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney—many "professional criminals" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790.	在 1788 年至 1792 年間，共有 3,546 名男性及 766 名女性受刑人來到雪梨—其中有許多「術有專精的犯人」具有建立殖民地所需的些許技能。1790 年，當地的食物供應情況來到了緊要關頭。
Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce.	早年的農業發展困難重重，來自海外的貨物供應也十分稀缺。
From 1791 on, however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.	然而，到了 1791 年之後，定期往返的船隻越來越多。後來隨著貿易開通，孤立感越來越淡，供應狀況也有所改善。
The colony was not founded on the principles of freedom and prosperity.	該處殖民地當初並非是以自由及繁榮做為創建原則。
Maps from this time show no prison buildings; the punishment for convicts was transportation rather than incarceration, but serious offences were penalised by flogging and hanging.	這時候的地圖上還沒出現牢房建築。對於受刑人來說，搭船還比監禁更像處罰，不過重罪要犯還是會受到鞭刑及吊刑等處分。
Phillip sent exploratory missions in search of better soils and fixed on the Parramatta region as a promising area for expansion and moved many of the convicts from late 1788 to establish a small township, which became the main centre of the colony's economic life, leaving Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life.	Phillip 派遣探索團隊尋找更優質的土壤，並且認定帕拉瑪塔 (Parramatta) 為具有發展潛力的地區。接著從 1788 年年末開始將許多受刑人遷移至此，開始建立小型城鎮，並在之後成為該殖民地的經濟生活重心，讓雪梨灣單純成為一座重要港灣，並聚焦於社交生活。
Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and Toongabbie, but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily.	設備破舊加上對於當地的土壤及氣候並不熟悉，在在妨礙著從農場灣 (Farm Cove) 到帕拉瑪塔和圖恩加比 (Toongabbie) 一帶的農業拓展，不過在受刑人付出勞力協助之下，有一項建設計畫得以穩步向前。
Officers and convicts alike faced starvation as supplies ran low and little could be cultivated from the land.	因為供應量短缺且土地難以栽種作物，官員和受刑人同樣都面臨著飢荒處境。
The region's indigenous population was also suffering.	當地的原住民族同樣也叫苦連天。
It is estimated that half of the native people in Sydney died during the smallpox epidemic of 1789.	據估計，在 1789 年的天花疫情當中，雪梨的原民人口有半數喪命。

Part of Macquarie's effort to transform the colony was his authorisation for convicts to re-enter society as free citizens.	昔日總督 Macquarie 曾透過自身權力允許受刑人以自由公民身分重新融入社會，努力讓殖民地有所轉變。
Roads, bridges, wharves, and public buildings were constructed using convict labour and by 1822 the town had banks, markets, and well-established thoroughfares.	在受刑人齊心勞力之下，道路、橋樑、碼頭及公共建築紛紛建設完成。到了 1822 年，鎮上已有銀行、市場和規劃完善的道路系統。

In 1804, Irish convicts led the Castle Hill Rebellion, a rebellion by convicts against colonial authority in the Castle Hill area of the British colony of New South Wales.	1804 年，愛爾蘭裔的受刑人發動「堡壘山起義」(Castle Hill Rebellion )，帶領受刑人反抗堡壘山地區的殖民地官署。堡壘山位於新南威爾斯的英國殖民地上。
The first and only major convict uprising in Australian history suppressed under martial law, the rebellion ended in a battle fought between convicts and the colonial forces of Australia at Rouse Hill.	這場澳洲史上第一起也是唯一一起受刑人揭竿起義的事件，隨後讓戒嚴法壓了下去。最後一場受刑人對抗殖民政府軍的戰役發生在澳洲的勞斯山 (Rouse Hill)。
The Rum Rebellion of 1808 was the only successful armed takeover of government in Australian history, where the Governor of New South Wales, William Bligh, was ousted by the New South Wales Corps under the command of Major George Johnston, who led the rebellion.	1808 年的「蘭姆酒暴動」(Rum Rebellion) 為澳洲史上唯一一起成功以武裝佔領政府機關的動亂事件。當時的新南威爾斯總督 William Bligh 在暴動領導人 George Johnston 少校的命令之下，遭新南威爾斯軍驅逐出境。

Demand for infrastructure to support the growing population and subsequent economic activity led to massive improvements to the city's railway and port systems throughout the 1850s and 1860s.	在 1850 年代及 1860 年代，為支持人口增長以及隨之蓬勃發展的經濟活動，對於基礎建設的需求表現在城市鐵路及港口交通系統的大規模改善上。
After a period of rapid growth, further discoveries of gold in Victoria began drawing new residents away from Sydney towards Melbourne in the 1850s, which created a strong rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne that still exists to this day.	經歷過一段快速成長期之後，有人在澳洲的維多利亞省進一步挖掘出金礦，吸引新一代居民於 1850 年代自雪梨轉往墨爾本而去，造就雪梨與墨爾本之間的瑜亮情結，延續至今。

Aotearoa (pronounced /ˌaʊtɛəˈroʊ.ə/; often translated as "land of the long white cloud") is the current Māori name for New Zealand.	「Aotearoa」(發音為 /ˌaʊtɛəˈroʊ.ə/，通常譯為「悠長白雲之地」) 為紐西蘭目前的毛利語名稱。
It is unknown whether Māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans, with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island.	目前並不清楚毛利人是否曾在歐洲人抵達之前就命名了這整座國家，而「Aotearoa」原先只是用來指稱北島。
Māori had several traditional names for the two main islands, including Te Ika-a-Māui (the fish of Māui) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu (the waters of greenstone) or Te Waka o Aoraki (the canoe of Aoraki) for the South Island.	毛利人曾經有好幾個用來稱呼這兩座主要島嶼的傳統名稱，包括用來稱呼北島的 Te Ika-a-Māui (毛伊魚島) 和用來稱呼南島的 Te Waipounamu (碧石水岸) 或 Te Waka o Aoraki (庫克山下的獨木舟)。
Early European maps labelled the islands North (North Island), Middle (South Island) and South (Stewart Island / Rakiura).	早年的歐洲地圖曾標示出北島 (即今日的北島)、中島 (今日的南島) 和南島 (今日的斯圖爾特島)。
In 1830, mapmakers began to use "North" and "South" on their maps to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907 this was the accepted norm.	1830 年，製圖師開始在地圖上使用「北島」和「南島」來區分兩座大島，隨後到了 1907 年便普遍為世人所接受。
The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised, and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013.	紐西蘭地理委員會 (New Zealand Geographic Board) 於 2009 年發現「北島」和「南島」其實從未列為正式名稱，其後於 2013 年正式確立了官方名稱及別名。

New Zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans.	紐西蘭是人類到了近代才正式定居的主要陸地區域之一。
Radiocarbon dating, evidence of deforestation and mitochondrial DNA variability within Māori populations suggest New Zealand was first settled by Eastern Polynesians between 1250 and 1300, concluding a long series of voyages through the southern Pacific islands.	據放射性碳定年法、曾大範圍砍伐森林的證據和毛利族人的粒線體基因變異情形推斷，紐西蘭的第一代居民可能是在西元 1250 年至 1300 年間途經諸多南太平洋海島，最後來此定居的東玻里尼西亞人 (Eastern Polynesian)。
Over the centuries that followed, these settlers developed a distinct culture now known as Māori.	在之後的數百年間，這群先民逐漸發展出獨特的文化體系，即現今所知的毛利文化。
The population was divided into iwi (tribes) and hapū (subtribes) who would sometimes cooperate, sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other.	島上的居民分成許多 iwi (部落) 和 hapū (分支部落)，有時會彼此合作，有時則會相互競爭，有的時候還會集體械鬥。
At some point a group of Māori migrated to Rēkohu, now known as the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinct Moriori culture.	有一群毛利族人曾在某個時間點遷居至 Rēkohu (即今日的查塔姆群島)，隨後發展出獨樹一格的莫里奧里 (Moriori) 文化。
The Moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862, largely because of Taranaki Māori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s, although European diseases also contributed.	但是莫里奧里族人卻在 1835 年至 1862 年間慘遭滅族，主因為塔拉納基地區 (Taranki) 的毛利族人於 1830 年代大舉入侵並以當地居民為奴，來自歐洲的疫病也是其中一部分原因。
In 1862 only 101 survived, and the last known full-blooded Moriori died in 1933.	到了 1862 年，僅剩下 101 人存活。目前已知最後一位血統純正的莫里奧里族人則於 1933 年逝世。
The first Europeans known to have reached New Zealand were Dutch explorer Abel Tasman and his crew in 1642.	據目前所知，第一批抵達紐西蘭的歐洲人是於 1642 年踏上這塊土地的荷蘭探險家 Abel Tasman 和同行的隊員。
In a hostile encounter, four crew members were killed and at least one Māori was hit by canister shot.	在登島時的流血衝突中，有四名隊員遭到殺害，至少有一名毛利族人遭受槍擊。
Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769 when British explorer James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline.	歐洲人直到 1769 年才再度造訪紐西蘭，當時的英國探險家 James Cook 在地圖上繪製了近乎完整的海岸線。
Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling, sealing and trading ships.	在 Cook 之後，有許多歐洲和北美地區的捕鯨船、貨運船和商船造訪了紐西蘭。
They traded European food, metal tools, weapons and other goods for timber, Māori food, artefacts and water.	他們用歐洲的食物、金屬器具、武器和其他貨物來此交易木材、毛利人的食物、工藝品和水資源。
The introduction of the potato and the musket transformed Māori agriculture and warfare.	在引進馬鈴薯和滑膛槍 (musket) 之後，毛利族人的農業和作戰能力有所轉變。
Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus, which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns.	馬鈴薯提供了可靠穩定的食糧補給，得以支撐時間更長且更為持久的軍事活動，
The resulting intertribal Musket Wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840, killing 30,000–40,000 Māori.	這導致了各個部落在 1801 年至 1840 年間發生了滑膛槍戰爭，大小戰役超過 600 場，造成 30,000 至 40,000 名毛利族人喪生。
From the early 19th century, Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand, eventually converting most of the Māori population.	基督教的傳教士從十九世紀早期就開始定居紐西蘭，最終讓大多數的毛利族人受洗入教。
The Māori population declined to around 40% of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced diseases were the major factor.	相較於與外人接觸之前，毛利族人的人口數量在十九世紀當中減少了四成，外來的疫病為主要因素。

In 1835, following an announcement of impending French settlement by Charles de Thierry, the nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand sent a Declaration of Independence to King William IV of the United Kingdom asking for protection.	1835 年，在 Charles de Thierry 公開宣告即將在此建立法屬根據地之後，紐西蘭的聯合部落不知該如何是好，於是遞交了一份獨立聲明給英皇威廉四世，尋求軍事庇護。
Ongoing unrest, the proposed settlement of New Zealand by the New Zealand Company (which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from Māori) and the dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for the United Kingdom and negotiate a treaty with the Māori.	鑒於風波尚未平息，原先打算在紐西蘭建立根據地的紐西蘭公司 (之前已經派出第一批調查團隊向毛利族人購買土地) 以及獨立宣言曖昧不明的法律地位促使英國殖民地辦公室指派 William Hobson 隊長前往宣示英國主權，並與毛利族人進行條約談判。
The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840.	1840 年 2 月 6 日，《懷唐伊條約》(The Treaty of Waitangi) 首度於島灣地區 (Bay of Islands) 進行簽署。
In response to the New Zealand Company's attempts to establish an independent settlement in Wellington and French settlers purchasing land in Akaroa, Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840, even though copies of the Treaty were still circulating throughout the country for Māori to sign.	為回應紐西蘭公司在威靈頓 (Wellington) 建設獨立根據地的企圖，以及法裔居民在阿卡羅阿 (Akaroa) 購買土地一事，Hobson 於 1840 年 5 月 21 日公開宣示英國具有紐西蘭全境的主權，儘管當時的條約複本還在各毛利部族之間傳遞以完成簽署。
With the signing of the Treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants, particularly from the United Kingdom, began to increase.	有了條約簽署及主權宣示之後，移民人數 (尤其是來自英國的移民) 開始增加。
New Zealand, still part of the colony of New South Wales, became a separate Colony of New Zealand on 1 July 1841.	當時還隸屬於新南威爾斯的紐西蘭，後來於 1841 年 7 月 1 日獨自成為直屬英國的紐西蘭殖民地。
Armed conflict began between the Colonial government and	1843 年，殖民政府開始和
Māori in 1843 with the Wairau Affray over land and disagreements over sovereignty.	毛利族人為了土地和主權糾紛發生武裝衝突，史稱「懷勞之爭」(Wairau Affray)。
These conflicts, mainly in the North Island, saw thousands of Imperial troops and the Royal Navy come to New Zealand and became known as the New Zealand Wars.	這些衝突事件主要發生在北島，接著有上千名帝國軍隊和皇家海軍進駐紐西蘭，逐漸演變成知名的「紐西蘭戰爭」(New Zealand Wars)。
Following these armed conflicts, large amounts of Māori land was confiscated by the government to meet settler demands.	在這些武裝衝突過後，為因應殖民需求，有大量的毛利族人土地遭到政府沒收。
The colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first Parliament met in 1854.	1852 年，紐西蘭成立了代議政府，並於 1854 首度召開議會。
In 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing, gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy.	1856 年，紐西蘭成為具有實質效力的自治區，負責掌管除原住民政策之外的所有境內事務。
(Control over native policy was granted in the mid-1860s.)	(原住民政策的管理權責則於 1860 年代中期獲准)

In 1907, at the request of the New Zealand Parliament, King Edward VII proclaimed New Zealand a Dominion within the British Empire, reflecting its self-governing status.	1907 年，在紐西蘭議會的請求之下，英皇愛德華七世宣布紐西蘭成為大英帝國的自治領 (Dominion)，以反映其自治現況。
In 1947 the country adopted the Statute of Westminster, confirming that the British Parliament could no longer legislate for New Zealand without the consent of New Zealand.	1947 年，紐西蘭政府採納了《西敏法令》(Statute of Westminister)，確認英國議會不可在未經紐西蘭同意下為紐西蘭制定任何法規。
Early in the 20th century, New Zealand was involved in world affairs, fighting in the First and Second World Wars and suffering through the Great Depression.	紐西蘭於二十世紀早期參與了許多國際事務，包括參戰第一次及第二次世界大戰，並且在經濟大蕭條時期困苦度日。
The depression led to the election of the First Labour Government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy.	經濟大蕭條讓紐西蘭工黨首度贏得大選，建立了全方位的福利國家制度及以保護主義為首的經濟體制。
New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War and Māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work.	紐西蘭在二戰結束後迎來榮景，毛利族人也開始離開傳統的鄉間生活，前往都市尋求工作機會。
A Māori protest movement developed, which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of Māori culture and of the Treaty of Waitangi.	批判歐洲中心主義的毛利族抗爭運動此時應運而生，戮力於讓更多人認識毛利族人的文化以及《懷唐伊條約》。
In 1975, a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty, and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985.	1975 年，懷唐伊委員會 (Waitangi Tribunal) 正式成立，負責調查條約中疑似侵害他人權利的部分條文，並於 1985 年獲准調查歷史上的種種恩怨情仇。
The government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi, although Māori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s.	政府與許多部落就過去的恩怨達成和解，不過毛利族人於 2000 年後對於當地海岸及海床聲稱的主權仍有諸多爭議。
New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified.	紐西蘭為實行內閣制的君主立憲國家，不過其憲法並未正式編成法典。
Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand and thus the head of state.	英國女皇伊莉莎白二世為現今紐西蘭的國家元首。
The Queen is represented by the governor-general, whom she appoints on the advice of the prime minister.	總督為女皇的職務代理人，會先由總理提名，再由女皇親自任命。
The governor-general can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors and other key public officials, and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power to dissolve parliament or refuse the royal assent of a bill into law).	總督可行使皇室賦予的特權，諸如審視冤案、任命部會首長、大使及其他重要的政府官員，以及在罕見的情況下動用其儲備權力 (例如解散國會或拒絕讓皇室同意的法案完成立法程序)。
The powers of the monarch and the governor-general are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.	君主及總督的權力均受憲法規範，一般來說必須先徵詢總理意見才能行使。
The New Zealand Parliament holds legislative power and consists of the Queen and the House of Representatives.	紐西蘭國會具有立法權，由女皇及眾議院所組成。
It also included an upper house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950.	國會體制中曾有專職為立法委員會的上議院，直到於 1950 年遭到廢除為止。
The supremacy of parliament over the Crown and other government institutions was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand.	國會的至高權力在皇室及其他政府機構之上，其法源依據為英國於 1689 年頒布的《權利法案》(Bill of Rights)，後來由紐西蘭政府批准入法。
The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats.	眾議院經民主選舉產生，然後由掌握過半席次的政黨或聯盟組建政府。
If no majority is formed, a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured.	如果沒有任一政黨或聯盟取得過半席次，可在具有信任基礎且不影響選票權益的前提下取得其他政黨團體的支持，組建少數政府。
The governor-general appoints ministers under advice from the prime minister, who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition.	總督可任命由總理提名的部會首長。依照慣例，總理為掌握國會多數席次的執政黨或執政聯盟的領導人。
Cabinet, formed by ministers and led by the prime minister, is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions.	內閣由各部會首長組成，由總理負責領導，為政府體制中負責制定政策的最高權力機構，負責為政府做出重大決策。
Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively, and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions.	閣員會集體做出重要決策，也因此會集體負責其決策後果。
A parliamentary general election must be called no later than three years after the previous election.	國會普選必須在前一任期開始後的三年內舉行。
Almost all general elections between 1853 and 1993 were held under the first-past-the-post voting system.	在 1853 年至 1993 年間的所有普選均採用領先者當選 (first-past-the-post) 做為票選制度。
Since the 1996 election, a form of proportional representation called mixed-member proportional (MMP) has been used.	從 1996 年的選舉開始改用結合了政黨比例代表的混合制 (mixed-member proportional，簡稱 MMP)。
Under the MMP system, each person has two votes; one is for a candidate standing in the voter's electorate and the other is for a party.	在 MMP 票選制度下，每一位選民都有兩張票，一張投給選區內的政黨候選人，另一張票則是投給政黨。
Since the 2014 election, there have been 71 electorates (which include seven Māori electorates in which only Māori can optionally vote), and the remaining 49 of the 120 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote, with the threshold that a party must win at least one electorate or 5% of the total party vote before it is eligible for a seat.	自 2014 年的選舉開始，全國劃分為 71 個選區 (其中包括 7 個只有毛利族人可以投票的專屬選區)，總共 120 席國會議員中剩下的 49 席則會按照政黨得票比例依序分配給各個政黨。任一政黨必須至少贏得一個選區，或是得票率超過總政黨票數的 5% 才能取得席次分配資格。
Elections since the 1930s have been dominated by two political parties, National and Labour.	自 1930 年代的選舉以來，幾乎都是兩大政黨 (國家黨和工黨) 的天下。
Between March 2005 and August 2006, New Zealand became the first country in the world in which all the highest offices in the land—head of state, governor-general, prime minister, speaker and chief justice—were occupied simultaneously by women.	在 2005 年 3 月至 2006 年 8 月期間，紐西蘭成為全球第一個所有政府首長均同時由女性擔任 (包括國家元首、總督、總理、發言人和首席大法官) 的國家。
The current prime minister is Jacinda Ardern, who has been in office since 26 October 2017.	現任總理為 Jacinda Ardern，於 2017 年 10 月 26 日走馬上任。
She is the country's third female prime minister.	她是紐西蘭史上第三位女總理。
New Zealand's judiciary, headed by the chief justice, includes the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts.	紐西蘭的司法機關以首席大法官為首，下轄最高法院、上訴法院、高等法院和初等法院。
Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence.	法官和司法官員均為非政治任命，其任期受到嚴格法律規範，以協助維護司法獨立。
This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions.	理論上，這樣會讓司法機關得以單純依照國會所制定的法律來詮釋相關條文，在決策過程中不會受到其他影響。
New Zealand is identified as one of the world's most stable and well-governed states.	紐西蘭是全球公認政局最穩定且治理表現最為良好的國家。
As at 2017, the country was ranked fourth in the strength of its democratic institutions, and first in government transparency and lack of corruption.	2017 年，紐西蘭的民主政治實力排行第四，政府透明程度及清廉程度則穩居第一。
A 2017 Human Rights Report by the U.S. Department of State noted that the government generally respected the rights of individuals, but voiced concerns regarding the social status of the Māori population.	美國國務院於 2017 年發表的《人權報告》(Human Rights Report) 中提到紐西蘭政府能普遍尊重每一位民眾的個人權利，但也對於毛利族人的社會地位表達關切。
New Zealand ranks highly for civic participation in the political process, with 77% voter turnout during recent elections, compared to an OECD average of 69%.	紐西蘭的公民政治參與度名列前茅，最近幾次選舉的投票率平均達到七成七，相較於經濟合作暨發展組織 (OECD) 成員國的平均值僅達六成九。
Early colonial New Zealand allowed the British Government to determine external trade and be responsible for foreign policy.	早年仍處於殖民時期的紐西蘭會讓英國政府決定海外貿易及外交政策。
The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan.	在 1923 年至 1926 年間，帝國會議決定開放讓紐西蘭自行協商政治條約，並於 1928 年與日本正式簽署第一份商業條約。
On 3 September 1939 New Zealand allied itself with Britain and declared war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage proclaiming, "Where she goes, we go; where she stands, we stand."	1939 年 9 月 3 日，紐西蘭與英國結盟，共同向德國宣戰。當時的總理 Michael Joseph 曾公開宣告：「我們願隨女皇前行，願隨女皇力抗強敵」。
In 1951 the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European interests, while New Zealand joined Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty.	1951 年，英國開始日益關注在歐陸國家之間的利弊得失，此時紐西蘭已經加入由澳洲和美國主導的澳紐美安全保障條約 (ANZUS security treaty)。
The influence of the United States on New Zealand weakened following protests over the Vietnam War, the refusal of the United States to admonish France after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues and New Zealand's nuclear-free policy.	美國對於紐西蘭造成的影響，弱化了之後反越戰、反對美國在彩虹勇士號沈船後責怪法國，以及針對環境、農業交易及反核政策等議題表達反對意見的抗爭力道。
Despite the United States' suspension of ANZUS obligations the treaty remained in effect between New Zealand and Australia, whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend.	儘管美國暫時擱置了 ANZUS 條約中明定的義務，該項條約仍然在紐澳雙方之間具有實質效力，兩者的外交政策也依循著相似的歷史趨勢。
Close political contact is maintained between the two countries, with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit, live and work in both countries without restrictions.	這兩個國家向來在政治上合作無間，並共同簽署了多項自由貿易及旅遊協定，讓彼此的公民能夠在兩國之間隨意旅遊、居住與工作，不受任何拘束。
In 2013 there were about 650,000 New Zealand citizens living in Australia, which is equivalent to 15% of the resident population of New Zealand.	到了 2013 年。大約有六十五萬名紐西蘭公民住在澳洲，相當於紐西蘭常住人口總數的一成五。
New Zealand has a strong presence among the Pacific Island countries.	紐西蘭在太平洋島國之間的地位舉足輕重。
A large proportion of New Zealand's aid goes to these countries and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment.	紐西蘭的對外援助有一大部分給了這些島國，而且有許多太平洋島國的居民會為了就業機會遷居至紐西蘭。
Permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access Category, which allow up to 1,100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year.	1970 年的《薩摩亞移民配額方案》(Samoan Quota Scheme) 及 2002 年的《太平洋島國移民簽證分類制度》(Pacific Access Category) 分別規範了國外移民永久居留的相關事宜，每年最多開放讓 1,100 名薩摩亞國民及 750 名其他島國的公民成為紐西蘭的永久居民。
A seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007 and in 2009 about 8,000 Pacific Islanders were employed under it.	適合短期移民的季節性工作簽證計畫則於 2007 年開始實行，到了 2009 年已經有大約 8,000 名太平洋島國民眾透過此計畫受僱工作。
A regional power, New Zealand is involved in the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum (including the East Asia Summit).	紐西蘭身為區域強國，接連參與了太平洋島國論壇 (Pacific Islands Forum)、太平洋共同體 (the Pacific Community)、亞太經濟合作會議 (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) 以及東協區域論壇 (Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum) 和論壇中的東亞高峰會 (the East Asia Summit)。
New Zealand is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and participates in the Five Power Defence Arrangements.	紐西蘭為聯合國以及經濟合作暨發展組織 (OECD) 的成員國，此外也參與了《五國聯防協議》(Five Power Defence Arrangements)。
In computing, a printer is a peripheral device which makes a persistent representation of graphics or text on paper.	在使用電腦時，印表機是能夠讓圖像及文字重現於紙上的一項電腦周邊設備。
While most output is human-readable, bar code printers are an example of an expanded use for printers.	儘管大多數的輸出項目都是人類能夠閱讀理解的內容，條碼印表機卻展現出印表機更為廣泛的用途。
The first computer printer designed was a mechanically driven apparatus by Charles Babbage for his difference engine in the 19th century; however, his mechanical printer design was not built until 2000.	第一台電腦印表機為以機械驅動的儀器設備，由 Charles Babbage 於十九世紀為了自己的差分機 (difference engine) 所設計而成。然而，他的機械印表機設計卻直到西元 2000 年才付諸實現。
The first electronic printer was the EP-101, invented by Japanese company Epson and released in 1968.	第一台電子印表機為 EP-101，由日本的愛普生 (Epson) 公司所發明，並於 1968 年正式亮相。
The first commercial printers generally used mechanisms from electric typewriters and Teletype machines.	第一批商用印表機一般而言都是運用電動打字機及電傳打字機的機械原理。
The demand for higher speed led to the development of new systems specifically for computer use.	為因應更高的速度需求，開始出現專門為電腦使用所設計的新系統。
In the 1980s there were daisy wheel systems similar to typewriters, line printers that produced similar output but at much higher speed, and dot matrix systems that could mix text and graphics but produced relatively low-quality output.	到了 1980 年代，相繼出現與打字機相仿的菊輪系統 (daisy wheel system)、能夠以更高速度輸出相似內容的行式印表機 (line printer)，以及能夠結合文字及圖像，但輸出品質不甚理想的點陣圖系統 (dot matrix system)。
The plotter was used for those requiring high quality line art like blueprints.	繪圖機 (plotter) 則是專門用來繪製如建築藍圖等要求高品質的線條圖。
The introduction of the low-cost laser printer in 1984 with the first HP LaserJet, and the addition of PostScript in next year's Apple LaserWriter, set off a revolution in printing known as desktop publishing.	第一台 HP LaserJet 系列印表機於 1984 上市，開始出現價格低廉的雷射印表機。隔年，蘋果公司推出附加了 PostScript 程式語言的 LaserWriter 印表機，掀起了如今稱為「桌上出版」的印刷技術革命。
Laser printers using PostScript mixed text and graphics, like dot-matrix printers, but at quality levels formerly available only from commercial typesetting systems.	使用 PostScript 語法的雷射印表機能夠像點陣圖印表機那樣結合文字和圖像，卻能擁有之前只能靠商用打字機系統達到的品質水準。
By 1990, most simple printing tasks like fliers and brochures were now created on personal computers and then laser printed; expensive offset printing systems were being dumped as scrap.	到了 1990 年，如宣傳單和手冊等十分簡單的印刷作業，都能透過個人電腦設計排版，然後用雷射印表機列印出來。昂貴的平版印刷系統頓時被棄如敝屣。
The HP Deskjet of 1988 offered the same advantages as a laser printer in terms of flexibility, but produced somewhat lower quality output (depending on the paper) from much less expensive mechanisms.	於 1988 年推出的 HP DeskJet 系列印表機和雷射印表機同樣享有靈活精巧等優點，卻能透過更加低廉的機械運作方式產出品質還不算太差 (取決於紙張材質) 的輸出內容。
Inkjet systems rapidly displaced dot matrix and daisy wheel printers from the market.	噴墨印刷系統迅速取代了市面上的點陣圖及菊輪印表機。
By the 2000s high-quality printers of this sort had fallen under the $100 price point and became commonplace.	到了西元 2000 年之後，這類高品質的印表機售價跌破百元美金，成為日常設備。
The rapid update of internet email through the 1990s and into the 2000s has largely displaced the need for printing as a means of moving documents, and a wide variety of reliable storage systems means that a "physical backup" is of little benefit today.	從 1990 年代到 2000 年後，網際網路的電子郵件系統日新月異，成為搬移文件檔案的新方法，大幅取代了印刷需求，再加上有各式各樣安全可靠的儲存系統，「實體備份」如今不再具有優勢。
Even the desire for printed output for "offline reading" while on mass transit or aircraft has been displaced by e-book readers and tablet computers.	即便是在大眾運輸工具或飛機上「離線閱讀」紙本印刷品的慾望，也已經讓電子書閱讀器和平板電腦取而代之。
Today, traditional printers are being used more for special purposes, like printing photographs or artwork, and are no longer a must-have peripheral.	如今，傳統印表機更常運用在列印照片或藝術作品等特殊目的，不再是必備的電腦周邊設備。
Starting around 2010, 3D printing became an area of intense interest, allowing the creation of physical objects with the same sort of effort as an early laser printer required to produce a brochure.	3D 列印技術大約從 2010 年開始發展，並逐漸成為讓眾人備感興趣的領域。3D 列印能夠像早期的雷射印表機在列印手冊那樣，輕鬆列印出實體物品。
These devices are in their earliest stages of development and have not yet become commonplace.	這些裝置都還在初步研發階段，尚未普及化。
Personal printers are primarily designed to support individual users, and may be connected to only a single computer.	個人印表機主要是用來支援個人使用者，僅能連接到一台電腦上。
These printers are designed for low-volume, short-turnaround print jobs, requiring minimal setup time to produce a hard copy of a given document.	這些印表機都是專為數量少且週期短的列印工作所設計，只需要花點時間安裝設定就能產出所輸入文件的紙本複本。
However, they are generally slow devices ranging from 6 to around 25 pages per minute (ppm),	然而這些印表機一般來說速度都不快，每分鐘大約可列印 6 至 25 頁，
and the cost per page is relatively high.	而且每一頁的平均成本都相對高了些。
However, this is offset by the on-demand convenience.	不過，其隨插即用的便利性倒是能彌補這些缺點。
Some printers can print documents stored on memory cards or from digital cameras and scanners.	有些印表機可以列印儲存在記憶卡中或是透過數位相機和掃瞄器擷取的文件檔案。
Networked or shared printers are "designed for high-volume, high-speed printing".	可連接網路或進行共享的印表機則是「專門用來進行大量且高速的列印作業」。
They are usually shared by many users on a network and can print at speeds of 45 to around 100 ppm.	這類印表機通常會透過網路連線共享給多位使用者，列印速度大約為每分鐘 45 至 100 頁。
The Xerox 9700 could achieve 120 ppm.	Xerox 9700 印表機可達到每分鐘 120 頁。
A virtual printer is a piece of computer software whose user interface and API resembles that of a printer driver, but which is not connected with a physical computer printer.	虛擬印表機為一款電腦軟體，其使用者介面及應用程式介面均類似印表機的驅動程式，只不過並未連接到實體的電腦印表機。
A virtual printer can be used to create a file which is an image of the data which would be printed, for archival purposes or as input to another program, for example to create a PDF or to transmit to another system or user.	虛擬印表機可以用來把所要列印的資料圖檔另建新檔封存，或是輸入到另一個程式中，例如建立 PDF 檔或是傳送至另一個系統或另一位使用者。
A barcode printer is a computer peripheral for printing barcode labels or tags that can be attached to, or printed directly on, physical objects.	條碼印表機為用來列印條碼貼標或附加標籤的電腦周邊設備，也可以直接列印在實體物品上。
Barcode printers are commonly used to label cartons before shipment, or to label retail items with UPCs or EANs.	條碼印表機通常會用來在運送貨物之前貼標紙箱，或是將零售貨品貼上通用產品代碼 (UPC) 或歐洲商品條碼 (EAN) 等標籤。
A 3D printer is a device for making a three-dimensional object from a 3D model or other electronic data source through additive processes in which successive layers of material (including plastics, metals, food, cement, wood, and other materials) are laid down under computer control.	3D 印表機是用來將 3D 模型或其他來源的電子資料製成立體物件的裝置。該裝置會在電腦操控下，透過疊加程序一層一層鋪上列印材料 (包括塑膠、金屬、食物、水泥、木頭和其他材料)。
It is called a printer by analogy with an inkjet printer which produces a two-dimensional document by a similar process of depositing a layer of ink on paper.	列印過程就像是噴墨印表機在紙上噴灑上一層墨水，進而列印出一份 2D 文件。
The choice of print technology has a great effect on the cost of the printer and cost of operation, speed, quality and permanence of documents, and noise.	選擇不同的列印技術，對於印表機和列印操作的費用成本、速度、品質、文件的耐久程度以及噪音都有著相當大的影響。
Some printer technologies do not work with certain types of physical media, such as carbon paper or transparencies.	有些印表機的列印技術不適用於某些類型的實體媒介，比如厚紙板或是透明幻燈片。
A second aspect of printer technology that is often forgotten is resistance to alteration: liquid ink, such as from an inkjet head or fabric ribbon, becomes absorbed by the paper fibers, so documents printed with liquid ink are more difficult to alter than documents printed with toner or solid inks, which do not penetrate below the paper surface.	印表機技術有另一個經常讓人忘卻的特點，那就是它能防止更動：從噴嘴或色帶噴灑而出的液體墨水會讓紙纖維吸收進去。因此，相較於使用碳粉或固體墨水列印出來但墨跡並未穿透紙張表面的文件，使用液體墨水列印的文件會更加難以更動內容。
Cheques can be printed with liquid ink or on special cheque paper with toner anchorage so that alterations may be detected.	支票可以使用液體墨水列印，或是使用碳粉打印在特殊的支票用紙上，如此便可檢測出任何更動之處。
The machine-readable lower portion of a cheque must be printed using MICR toner or ink.	支票可以用機器識讀的下半部必須使用 MICR 碳粉或墨水列印。
Banks and other clearing houses employ automation equipment that relies on the magnetic flux from these specially printed characters to function properly.	銀行和其他票據交換所會採用自動偵測設備，唯有感應到這些特殊印刷字元的磁通量才能正常運作。
The following printing technologies are routinely found in modern printers:	下列均為會在現代印表機中經常看見的列印技術：
A laser printer rapidly produces high quality text and graphics.	雷射印表機快速列印出高品質的文字和圖像。
As with digital photocopiers and multifunction printers (MFPs), laser printers employ a xerographic printing process but differ from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of a laser beam across the printer's photoreceptor.	如同數位影印機和多功能印表機 (MFP)，雷射印表機也採用了靜電印刷程序。靜電印刷與類比式影印機的不同之處，在於它是使用雷射光柱在印表機的感光接受器上橫掃而過，直接掃描並生成圖像。
Another toner-based printer is the LED printer which uses an array of LEDs instead of a laser to cause toner adhesion to the print drum.	另一款使用碳粉的印表機為 LED 印表機，用一整排 LED 燈來取代雷射光束，讓碳粉吸附在列印磁鼓上。
Inkjet printers operate by propelling variably sized droplets of liquid ink onto almost any sized page.	噴墨印表機是藉由將不同大小的液體墨點噴射在紙張上來完成列印，幾乎各種大小的紙張都適用。
They are the most common type of computer printer used by consumers.	這類印表機是目前消費者最常使用的電腦印表機。
Solid ink printers, also known as phase-change printers, are a type of thermal transfer printer.	固體墨水印表機，別名為相位變更 (phase-change) 印表機，為使用熱傳導技術的印表機類別。
They use solid sticks of CMYK-coloured ink, similar in consistency to candle wax, which are melted and fed into a piezo crystal operated print-head.	這類印表機會使用標準四色 (CMYK) 固體墨條，墨條的質地類似蠟燭，會遇熱熔化並滴入由壓電晶體操控的列印頭。
The printhead sprays the ink on a rotating, oil coated drum.	列印頭會將墨水灑在不停旋轉且抹上一層油質的鼓面上。
The paper then passes over the print drum, at which time the image is immediately transferred, or transfixed, to the page.	接著紙張會通過列印鼓輪，圖像就會立即轉印到紙上。
Solid ink printers are most commonly used as colour office printers, and are excellent at printing on transparencies and other non-porous media.	固體墨水印表機最常用來當作辦公室內的彩色印表機，並且對於透明投影片或其他不會滲漏的媒介物質有絕佳的列印效果。
Solid ink printers can produce excellent results.	固體墨水印表機能夠列印出效果絕佳的成品。
Acquisition and operating costs are similar to laser printers.	購置成本和操作費用與雷射印表機不相上下。
Drawbacks of the technology include high energy consumption and long warm-up times from a cold state.	這項技術的缺點包括了高耗能及需要相當長的暖機時間。
Also, some users complain that the resulting prints are difficult to write on, as the wax tends to repel inks from pens, and are difficult to feed through automatic document feeders, but these traits have been significantly reduced in later models.	此外，有些使用者會抱怨說列印出來的成品很難用筆在上面書寫，因為表層的墨蠟會排斥筆寫出來的墨水，而且也難以送入自動送稿機。不過這些特性都在後來的機型中有顯著改善。
In addition, this type of printer is only available from one manufacturer, Xerox, manufactured as part of their Xerox Phaser office printer line.	除此之外，全球僅剩下全錄公司 (Xerox) 在製造這類印表機，屬於公司旗下 Xerox Phaser 事務機產線的一部分。
Previously, solid ink printers were manufactured by Tektronix, but Tek sold the printing business to Xerox in 2001.	在此之前，固體墨水印表機都是由太克公司 (Tektronix) 生產製造，不過太克公司已經於 2001 年將印表機事業部門出售給全錄公司。
A dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a printer which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, paper or canvas.	熱昇華印表機 (或稱為熱轉印機) 為運用熱能將染料轉印到塑膠卡片、紙張或畫布上的印表機。
The process is usually to lay one colour at a time using a ribbon that has colour panels.	這過程通常會使用上面附有調色板的色帶，一次只會印上一種顏色。
Dye-sub printers are intended primarily for high-quality colour applications, including colour photography; and are less well-suited for text.	熱轉印機主要應用在高畫質的彩色印刷上 (包含彩色照片)，較不適合用來轉印文字。
While once the province of high-end print shops, dye-sublimation printers are now increasingly used as dedicated consumer photo printers.	這類印表機曾是高檔印刷商行的專屬設備，如今逐漸成為專門用來轉印顧客照片的印表機。
Thermal printers work by selectively heating regions of special heat-sensitive paper.	熱感式印表機會選擇性加熱特殊感熱紙的不同區塊。
Monochrome thermal printers are used in cash registers, ATMs, gasoline dispensers and some older inexpensive fax machines.	單色熱感式印表機會運用在收銀機、自動提款機、加油機和某些老舊的廉價傳真機上。
Colours can be achieved with special papers and different temperatures and heating rates for different colours; these coloured sheets are not required in black-and-white output.	使用特殊的感熱紙及不同的溫度和加熱速率可列印出彩色圖樣。不過黑白輸出機台並不需要使用這些彩色感熱紙。
One example is Zink (a portmanteau of "zero ink").	Zink 技術 (「零墨水」(zero ink) 的簡寫代稱) 為其中一個範例。
The following technologies are either obsolete, or limited to special applications though most were, at one time, in widespread use.	下列技術均曾經廣泛使用過，但如今大多不是已經過時就是僅限於特殊應用。
Impact printers rely on a forcible impact to transfer ink to the media.	撞擊式印表機是靠強烈的撞擊力道將墨水轉印到媒介物質上。
The impact printer uses a print head that either hits the surface of the ink ribbon, pressing the ink ribbon against the paper (similar to the action of a typewriter), or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the ink ribbon (the IBM 1403 for example).	撞擊式印表機會使用列印頭來敲擊墨水色帶的表面，將色帶按壓在紙上 (類似打字機的打印動作)，或是 (但這比較不常見) 敲擊紙張背面，將紙按壓在色帶上 (例如 IBM 的 1403 型印表機就是如此)。
All but the dot matrix printer rely on the use of fully formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing.	在所有類型的印表機中，只有點陣式印表機需要使用完整字元，每一個字元都必須為印表機能夠列印出來的字形樣式。
In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although bolding and underlining of text could be done by "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or slightly offset.	除此之外，這類印表機大多數都侷限於單色 (有時可以是雙色)，而且一次只能列印單一字體。不過粗體和底線倒是可以藉由「重複撞擊」列印出來，也就是在同樣的字元位置或是略為偏移的位置壓印兩次以上。
Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisywheel printers, dot matrix printers and line printers.	撞擊式印表機的各類機型包括了打字印表機、電傳打字印表機、菊輪印表機、點陣式印表機以及行式印表機。
Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed.	點陣式印表機至今仍常見於商務場合，負責列印多合一表單。
An overview of impact printing contains a detailed description of many of the technologies used.	概觀撞擊列印技術，其中囊括了許多所用技術的詳盡描述。
Several different computer printers were simply computer-controllable versions of existing electric typewriters.	有幾款不同的電腦印表機其實只是可透過電腦操控的現代電子打字機。
The Friden Flexowriter and IBM Selectric-based printers were the most-common examples.	Friden Flexowriter 電傳印表機和 IBM 電動打字印表機為當時最常見的兩個例子。
The Flexowriter printed with a conventional typebar mechanism while the Selectric used IBM's well-known "golf ball" printing mechanism.	Flexowriter 印表機是透過傳統的打字連動桿機械結構來進行列印，電動打字印表機則使用 IBM 頗負盛名的「高爾夫球」機械列印結構。
In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon which was pressed against the paper, printing one character at a time.	兩者都是以字體敲擊色帶並按壓到紙上，一次壓印一個字元。
The maximum speed of the Selectric printer (the faster of the two) was 15.5 characters per second.	電動打字印表機的最高速度 (兩者間較快的一款) 為每秒列印 15.5 個字元。
The common teleprinter could easily be interfaced to the computer and became very popular except for those computers manufactured by IBM.	常見的電傳印表機除了由 IBM 製造的電腦之外，也能輕鬆連接其他電腦介面，十分受歡迎。
Some models used a "typebox" that was positioned, in the X- and Y-axes, by a mechanism and the selected letter form was struck by a hammer.	有些機型會使用位於 X 軸和 Y 軸之間的固定式「打字盒」，其機械運作方式為用槌子敲擊所選取的字體。
Others used a type cylinder in a similar way as the Selectric typewriters used their type ball.	其他機型則會使用打字圓筒，使用方式近似於電子打字機在用打字球。
In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon to print the letterform.	兩者都是以字體去敲擊色帶，進而將字體印上去。
Most teleprinters operated at ten characters per second although a few achieved 15 CPS.	大多數的電傳印表機的操作速度可達到每秒 10 個字元，不過也有少數機型達到每秒 15 個字元。
Daisy wheel printers operate in much the same fashion as a typewriter.	菊輪印表機的運作方式幾乎和打字機一模一樣。
A hammer strikes a wheel with petals, the "daisy wheel", each petal containing a letter form at its tip.	會有一支槌子負責敲擊由諸多瓣片組成的「菊輪」，每一片瓣片的尖端都有一個字母。
The letter form strikes a ribbon of ink, depositing the ink on the page and thus printing a character.	字體會敲擊墨水色帶，在紙上留下墨跡，進而將字元列印出來。
By rotating the daisy wheel, different characters are selected for printing.	轉動菊輪既可挑選不同的字元來進行列印。
These printers were also referred to as letter-quality printers because they could produce text which was as clear and crisp as a typewriter.	這類印表機因為能夠列印出如打字機般清晰俐落的文字，所以也有「鉛字品質印表機」之稱。
The fastest letter-quality printers printed at 30 characters per second.	速度最快的鉛字品質印表機可達到每秒列印 30 個字元。
Liquid ink electrostatic printers use a chemical coated paper, which is charged by the print head according to the image of the document.	液體墨水靜電印表機會使用塗上一層化學物質的影印紙，然後根據文件圖像由列印頭釋放電荷。
The paper is passed near a pool of liquid ink with the opposite charge.	接著紙張會通過帶著相反電荷的液體墨水池附近。
The charged areas of the paper attract the ink and thus form the image.	於是紙上附帶著電荷的區域就會吸附墨水，進而呈現出圖像。
This process was developed from the process of electrostatic copying.	這個列印程序是參考靜電複印的過程所發展出來。
Color reproduction is very accurate, and because there is no heating the scale distortion is less than ±0.1%.	色彩還原十分精準，而且因為過程不會產生熱度，所以比例失真的情形會在 ±0.1% 之間。
(All laser printers have an accuracy of ±1%.)	(所有雷射印表機的精準度都在 ±1% 之間。)
Worldwide, most survey offices used this printer before color inkjet plotters become popular.	彩色噴墨繪圖機廣受歡迎之前，世界各地大部分的測量處所都曾使用過這款印表機。
Liquid ink electrostatic printers were mostly available in 36 to 54 inches (910 to 1,370 mm) width and also 6 color printing.	液體墨水靜電印表機的寬度大多落在 36 至 54 英吋 (910 至 1,370 公釐) 之間，而且提供 6 色列印。
These were also used to print large billboards.	這類印表機以前也會用來列印大型廣告看板。
It was first introduced by Versatec, which was later bought by Xerox.	當年首台靜電印表機是由 Versatec 正式推出，後來由全錄公司收購。
3M also used to make these printers.	3M 公司也曾經製作過這類印表機。
Shampoo (/ʃæmˈpuː/) is a hair care product, typically in the form of a viscous liquid, that is used for cleaning hair.	洗髮精 (Shampoo，發音為：/ʃæmˈpuː/) 為護髮產品，一般而言會是黏稠液狀，可用來清潔頭髮。
Less commonly, shampoo is available in bar form, like a bar of soap.	洗髮精偶爾會以棒狀造型提供使用，就像是一條棒狀肥皂。
Shampoo is used by applying it to wet hair, massaging the product into the hair, and then rinsing it out.	使用洗髮精時，會先抹在濡濕的頭髮上，接著透過按摩讓頭髮吸收進去，最後再用水沖乾淨。
Some users may follow a shampooing with the use of hair conditioner.	有些使用者會在用完洗髮精後抹上護髮乳。
The typical reason of using shampoo is to remove the unwanted build-up of sebum in the hair without stripping out so much as to make hair unmanageable.	一般而言，洗髮精是用來清除頭髮上積累的皮脂，但並不會剝除掉過多皮脂而導致頭髮難以梳理。
Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water.	一般而言，洗髮精會將界面活性劑 (最常見的是月桂醇聚醚硫酸鈉 (sodium lauryl sulfate) 或肉桂醇聚醚硫酸鈉 (sodium laureth sulfate)) 及共界面活性劑 (最常見的是椰油醯胺丙基甜菜鹼 (cocamidopropyl betaine)) 和水結合在一起。
The sulphate ingredient acts as a surfactant, essentially heavy duty soap that makes it easier to trap oil and grease.	其中硫酸鹽成分的作用為界面活性劑，基本上就像是強力肥皂，能輕鬆將油脂包覆住。
Specialty shampoos are marketed to people with dandruff, color-treated hair, gluten or wheat allergies, an interest in using an organic product, and infants and young children ("baby shampoo" is less irritating).	市面上有各種專門的洗髮精，可提供給有頭皮屑、染髮、對於麩質或小麥過敏、喜歡使用有機產品以及嬰幼兒等不同族群的使用者 (「嬰兒洗髮精」比較不會刺激皮膚)。
There are also shampoos intended for animals that may contain insecticides or other medications to treat skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas.	此外還有專供動物使用的洗髮精，可能會包含殺蟲配方或是用來因應其他皮膚狀況或防止跳蚤等寄生蟲感染的藥劑。
The word shampoo entered the English language from the Indian subcontinent during the colonial era.	「shampoo」一詞是在殖民年代從印度次大陸傳入英文語境。
It dates to 1762 and is derived from Hindi chāmpo (चाँपो [tʃãːpoː]), itself derived from the Sanskrit root chapati (चपति), which means to press, knead, soothe.	起源可追溯至 1762 年，從印度文中的「chāmpo (चाँपो [tʃãːpoː])」衍生而來。其字根源為梵文中的「chapati (चपति)」，有按壓、搓揉及舒緩之意。
In the Indian subcontinent, a variety of herbs and their extracts have been used as shampoos since ancient times.	印度次大陸上的居民從遠古時代就開始把各式各樣的草本植物及其萃取物拿來當成洗髮精使用。
A very effective early shampoo was made by boiling Sapindus with dried Indian gooseberry (amla) and a selection of other herbs, using the strained extract.	早年有一種十分有效的洗髮精是將無患子 (Sapindus)、印度油甘果乾 (amla) 及其他精選的草本植物一同放入滾水熬煮，接著把殘渣濾掉，取其萃取液來使用。
Sapindus, also known as soapberries or soapnuts, a tropical tree widespread in India, is called ksuna (Sanskrit: क्षुण) in ancient Indian texts and its fruit pulp contains saponins which are a natural surfactant.	無患子 (別名皂漿果或肥皂果) 為印度境內廣泛栽植的熱帶樹種。在古印度文中，無患子被稱為「ksuna (梵文：क्षुण)」，而且它的果肉含有皂素 (saponins)，為天然的界面活性劑。
The extract of soapberries creates a lather which Indian texts called phenaka (Sanskrit: फेनक).	從皂漿果中提取出來的物質會產生一種皂沫，在印度文中稱為 「phenaka (梵文：फेनक)」。
It leaves the hair soft, shiny and manageable.	這種皂沫可以讓髮質柔軟、有亮澤且容易梳理。
Other products used for hair cleansing were shikakai (Acacia concinna), hibiscus flowers, ritha (Sapindus mukorossi) and arappu (Albizzia amara).	其他可以用來洗淨頭髮的天然產物還有小合歡 (印度文：shikakai/英文：Acacia concinna)、木槿花 (hibiscus flower)、印度無患子 (印度文：ritha/英文：Sapindus mukorossi) 以及阿拉瑪合歡 (印度文：arappu/英文：Albizzia amara)。
Guru Nanak, the founder and the first Guru of Sikhism, made references to soapberry tree and soap in the 16th century.	創立錫克教 (Sikhism) 的首任宗師那納克 (Guru Nanak) 曾在十六世紀時提到皂漿果樹以及肥皂。
Cleansing with hair and body massage (champu) during one's daily bath was an indulgence of early colonial traders in India.	對於早年居住於印度的殖民地商人而言，每天能在洗澡時使用按摩露 (champu) 洗淨頭髮和身體，是莫大的享受。
When they returned to Europe, they introduced the newly learned habits, including the hair treatment they called shampoo.	當他們返回歐洲時，也將這些新嗜好一起帶回去，包括了他們稱之為「shampoo」的洗髮用品。
Sake Dean Mahomed, an Indian traveller, surgeon, and entrepreneur, is credited with introducing the practice of champooi or "shampooing" to Britain.	身兼外科醫師和企業家的印度旅行家 Sake Dean Mahomed 被公認為將「按摩潔淨」(champooi 或 shampooing) 實際引進英國的第一人。
In 1814, Mahomed, with his Irish wife Jane Daly, opened the first commercial "shampooing" vapour masseur bath in England, in Brighton.	1814 年，Mahomed 和他的愛爾蘭裔妻子 Jane Daly 在英格蘭開設了第一家「按摩潔淨」(shampooing) 蒸氣舒壓商業澡堂。
He described the treatment in a local paper as "The Indian Medicated Vapour Bath (type of Turkish bath), a cure to many diseases and giving full relief when everything fails; particularly Rheumatic and paralytic, gout, stiff joints, old sprains, lame legs, aches and pains in the joints".	他在地方報紙上如此描述整體療程：「印度蒸氣藥浴 (土耳其浴的其中一種)，可療癒多種疾病，並能徹底舒緩遭受沉痛打擊的身心靈。對於風濕病、肢體麻痺、痛風、關節僵硬、陳舊扭傷、瘸腿、關節疼痛等症狀效果尤佳。」
During the early stages of shampoo in Europe, English hair stylists boiled shaved soap in water and added herbs to give the hair shine and fragrance.	在歐洲剛開始出現洗髮精的時候，英國的髮型設計師會將肥皂碎屑放在水裡煮，再加入香草植物來讓頭髮既有亮澤又芳香怡人。
Commercially made shampoo was available from the turn of the 20th century.	直到進入二十世紀的時候才出現商業生產的洗髮精。
A 1914 advertisement for Canthrox Shampoo in American Magazine showed young women at camp washing their hair with Canthrox in a lake; magazine advertisements in 1914 by Rexall featured Harmony Hair Beautifier and Shampoo.	Canthrox 洗髮精於 1914 年在《美國雜誌》(American Magazine) 上刊登的廣告中，繪製了一群宿營湖畔的年輕女性在湖中以 Canthrox 洗髮精洗頭髮的畫面。Rexall 公司於 1914 年所刊登的雜誌廣告中則重點推薦了 Harmony Hair Beautifier 及同名的洗髮精產品。
In 1927, liquid shampoo was invented by German inventor Hans Schwarzkopf in Berlin, whose name created a shampoo brand sold in Europe.	1927 年，德國發明家 Hans Schwarzkopf 在柏林發明了液體洗髮精，他的名字也成為一款在歐洲銷售洗髮精的品牌名稱。
Originally, soap and shampoo were very similar products; both containing the same naturally derived surfactants, a type of detergent.	一開始，肥皂和洗髮精是十分相近的產品。兩者都含有同樣的天然界面活性劑，而且都具有洗淨能力。
Modern shampoo as it is known today was first introduced in the 1930s with Drene, the first shampoo using synthetic surfactants instead of soap.	如今常見的現代洗髮精首見於 1930 年代推出的 Drene 洗髮精，這是史上第一款使用合成界面活性劑而非皂素的洗髮精。
Early shampoos used in Indonesia were made from the husk and straw (merang) of rice.	早年在印尼使用的洗髮精是用玉米殼和稻稈 (merang) 製成。
The husks and straws were burned into ash, and the ashes (which have alkaline properties) are mixed with water to form lather.	先將玉米殼和稻稈燒成灰，再將這些 (帶鹼性的) 灰燼混入水中產生泡沫。
The ashes and lather were scrubbed into the hair and rinsed out, leaving the hair clean, but very dry.	接著用這些灰燼和泡沫來刷洗頭髮，再用水沖掉。頭髮是洗乾淨了，但是會非常乾。
Afterwards, coconut oil was applied to the hair in order to moisturize it.	洗完頭髮之後，會再抹上一層椰子油來潤澤頭髮。
Certain Native American tribes used extracts from North American plants as hair shampoo; for example the Costanoans of present-day coastal California used extracts from the coastal woodfern, Dryopteris expansa,	某些美洲原住民族會使用從北美地區植物提取出來的物質來當成洗髮精，例如居住在現今加州沿岸的柯斯塔諾族人 (Costanoan) 就曾從岸邊的廣佈鱗毛蕨 (Dryopteris expansa) 提取用來洗髮的物質。
Before quinoa can be eaten the saponin must be washed out from the grain prior to cooking.	藜麥表皮上的皂苷必須先沖洗乾淨，才能拿來烹煮食用。
Pre-Columbian Andean civilizations used this soapy by-product as a shampoo.	前哥倫布時期的安地斯民族會將這項皂素副產品來當成洗髮精使用。
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates that shampoo containers accurately list ingredients on the products container.	美國的食品藥物管理局 (FDA) 下令要求所有洗髮精都必須在包裝瓶上確實列出所有成分。
The government further regulates what shampoo manufacturers can and cannot claim as any associated benefit.	政府進一步規範洗髮精製造商能否主張的相關利益內容。
Shampoo producers often use these regulations to challenge marketing claims made by competitors, helping to enforce these regulations.	洗髮精製造商通常會使用這些規範來質疑同業的行銷用語，進而協助加強這些規範的效力。
While the claims may be substantiated, however, the testing methods and details of such claims are not as straightforward.	這些行銷用語雖然都可能有經過證實，然而其檢測方式和詳細內容都不會多直截了當。
For example, many products are purported to protect hair from damage due to ultraviolet radiation.	例如有許多產品聲稱能夠保護頭髮免於紫外線危害。
While the ingredient responsible for this protection does block UV, it is not often present in a high enough concentration to be effective.	儘管負責保護頭髮的成分的確能抗阻紫外線，該成分的濃度卻往往達不到能提供功效的程度。。
The North American Hair Research Society has a program to certify functional claims based on third-party testing.	北美毛髮研究協會 (North American Hair Research Society) 有個計畫能夠經邀請第三方來透過檢測證實這些功能性用語。
Shampoos made for treating medical conditions such as dandruff or itchy scalp are regulated as OTC drugs in the US marketplace.	專門用來療治頭皮屑或頭皮癢的洗髮精都會在美國市場列入成藥規範。
In the European Union, there is a requirement for the anti-dandruff claim to be substantiated as with any other advertising claim, but it is not considered to be a medical problem.	歐盟地區規定，凡是有抗頭皮屑的廣告用語都必須跟其他用語一同經過證實，但歐盟並不認為這屬於醫療問題。
A number of contact allergens are used as ingredients in shampoos, and contact allergy caused by shampoos is well known.	有些接觸性過敏原會用來製造洗髮精，由洗髮精造成的接觸性過敏症狀也算是眾所皆知。
Patch testing can identify ingredients to which patients are allergic, after which a physician can help the patient find a shampoo that is free of the ingredient to which they are allergic.	貼布測試可以識別出哪些患者會對那些成分過敏，接著醫生就能協助患者找到不含過敏成分的洗髮精。
The US bans 11 ingredients from shampoos, Canada bans 587, and the EU bans 1328.	美國禁用了 11 項洗髮精成分，加拿大禁了 587 項，歐盟則禁了 1,328 項，
Cosmetic companies have developed shampoos specifically for those who have dandruff.	化妝品公司有特別針對那些有頭皮屑的客人研發出洗髮精。
These contain fungicides such as ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione and selenium disulfide, which reduce loose dander by killing fungi like Malassezia furfur.	這些洗髮精都內含殺真菌劑 (如酮康唑 (ketoconazole)、吡硫鎓鋅 (zinc pyrithione) 和二硫化硒 (selenium disulfide))，可透過殺死如秕糠馬拉癬菌 (Malassezia furfur) 之類的真菌來減少皮屑產生。
Coal tar and salicylate derivatives are often used as well.	焦油 (coal tar) 和水楊酸 (salicylate) 衍生物也都會經常拿來使用。
Alternatives to medicated shampoos are available for people who wish to avoid synthetic fungicides.	市面上也有藥用洗髮精的替代款式，提供給不想要使用合成殺真菌劑的民眾選購，
Such shampoos often use tea tree oil, essential oils or herbal extracts.	這類洗髮精通常會使用茶樹精油、各類天然精油或是草本精華。
Many companies have also developed color-protection shampoos suitable for colored hair; some of these shampoos contain gentle cleansers according to their manufacturers.	有許多公司也研發出護色洗髮精，適用於有染色的頭髮。這類洗髮精有一部分含有溫和的洗潔成分，依其製造商而有所不同。
They have the advantage of being spill-proof.	這類洗髮產品的優點在於不會溢漏出來。
They are easy to apply; one may simply rub the bar over wet hair, and work the soaped hair into a low lather.	使用起來也很方便：直接將條塊放在濡濕的頭髮上摩擦，直到頭髮都沾滿了些許泡沫即可。
Stiff, non-pourable clear gels to be squeezed from a tube were once popular forms of shampoo, and can be produced by increasing a shampoo's viscosity.	質地黏稠，只能從軟管中擠出來而無法倒出來的潔髮凝露，曾經一度成為廣受歡迎的洗髮精類型，可透過將洗髮精的黏稠度拉高而製造出來。
This type of shampoo cannot be spilled, but unlike a solid, it can still be lost down the drain by sliding off wet skin or hair.	這類洗髮產品不會溢漏出來，卻也並非固體，仍然會沿著濡濕的頭髮或肌膚滑落到排水孔中。
Shampoos in the form of pastes or creams were formerly marketed in jars or tubes.	做成膏狀或乳霜狀的洗髮乳，之前曾以罐裝或管裝形式上市販售。
The contents were wet but not completely dissolved.	其內容物含有一定的濕潤度，但並未完全溶解。
They would apply faster than solids and dissolve quickly.	可以比固體洗髮產品更快抹到頭髮上，並快速溶解於水。
Antibacterial shampoos are often used in veterinary medicine for various conditions, as well as in humans before some surgical procedures.	抗菌洗髮精通常會讓獸醫用來應對各種醫藥需求，以及供人類在進行某些手術前使用。
Closely associated with environmentalism, the "no poo" movement consists of people rejecting the societal norm of frequent shampoo use.	與環保主義密切相關的「No-Poo」運動是由一群拒絕接受將經常使用洗髮精當成社會規範的人士所推動。
Some adherents of the no poo movement use baking soda or vinegar to wash their hair, while others use diluted honey.	該運動的追隨者中有一些人會使用小蘇打粉或是醋來洗自己的頭髮，還有另一群人會使用稀釋過後的蜂蜜。
Other people use nothing, rinsing their hair only with conditioner.	其他人則什麼也不用，只使用護髮乳來清洗自己的頭髮。
In the 1970s, ads featuring Farrah Fawcett and Christie Brinkley asserted that it was unhealthy not to shampoo several times a week.	1970 年代，由 Farrah Fawcett 和 Christie Brinkley 主演的廣告聲稱一週不用洗髮精洗個幾次頭，頭髮就不會健康。
This mindset is reinforced by the greasy feeling of the scalp after a day or two of not shampooing.	頭皮在一天或兩天不用洗髮精洗頭之後所產生的油膩感，進一步強化了這種思維。
Using shampoo every day removes sebum, the oil produced by the scalp.	每天使用洗髮精可清除皮脂，也就是頭皮分泌出來的油脂。
This causes the sebaceous glands to produce oil at a higher rate, to compensate for what is lost during shampooing.	如此一來，皮脂腺會為了補充在洗髮過程中失去的油脂而加快分泌速率。
According to Michelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University, a gradual reduction in shampoo use will cause the sebum glands to produce at a slower rate, resulting in less grease in the scalp.	據哥倫比亞大學的皮膚科醫師 Michelle Hanjani 指出，逐步減少使用洗髮精會有助於讓皮脂腺減緩分泌速率，進而減少頭皮的油膩感。
Although this approach might seem unappealing to some individuals, many people try alternate shampooing techniques like baking soda and vinegar in order to avoid ingredients used in many shampoos that make hair greasy over time.	儘管這項方法對於某些人來說不具吸引力，但還是有許多人會為了避免接觸到在多款洗髮精中會讓頭髮逐漸變油的成分，嘗試使用其他方法來取代洗髮精，好比說使用小蘇打粉和醋。
A railway platform is an area alongside a railway track providing convenient access to trains.	鐵路月台為沿著鐵路軌道興建且方便讓乘客搭車的建築區域。
Almost all stations have some form of platform, with larger stations having multiple platforms.	幾乎所有車站都設有某種形式的月台，規模較大的車站裡則會有多條月台。
The world's longest station platform is at Gorakhpur Junction in India at 1,355.40 metres (4,446.9 ft).	世界上最長的車站月台位於印度的戈勒喀布爾聯合車站 (Gorakhpur Junction)，長達 1,355.40 公尺 (約 4,446.9 英尺)。
The Appalachian Trail station in the United States, at the other extreme, has a platform which is only long enough for a single bench.	美國的阿帕拉契登山步道 (Appalachian Trail) 車站則是另一個極端—月台長度僅容得下一張長椅。
Among some United States train conductors the word "platform" has entered usage as a verb meaning "to berth at a station", as in the announcement: "The last two cars of this train will not platform at East Rockaway".	在某些美國的列車調度員口中，會將「platform」一詞會當成動詞，意思是「在車站停靠」，好比這段廣播詞：「本次列車的最後兩節車廂將不會停靠東洛克威站」(The last two cars of this train will not platform at East Rockaway)。
The most basic form of platform consists of an area at the same level as the track, usually resulting in a fairly large height difference between the platform and the train floor.	最基本的月台形式是由一個和軌道高度相當的區域所構成，往往導致月台和車廂地板之間有相當大的高度落差。
This would often not be considered a true platform.	人們通常不會將這種月台當成真正的月台。
The more traditional platform is elevated relative to the track but often lower than the train floor, although ideally they should be at the same level.	更傳統的月台形式會比軌道高出一些，但通常會比車廂地板矮一點，儘管在理想狀態下，這兩者的高度應該要一致。
Occasionally the platform is higher than the train floor, where a train with a low floor serves a station built for trains with a high floor, for example at the Dutch stations of the DB Regionalbahn Westfalen (see Enschede).	偶爾會在低地板車廂來到適用於高地板車廂的月台時，出現月台比車廂地板還高的情形，例如德鐵區域鐵路西伐利亞線 (DB Regionalbahn Westfalen) 位於荷蘭境內的車站 (請參閱恩斯赫德 (Enschede) 相關內容)。
On the London Underground some stations are served by both District line and Piccadilly line trains, and the Piccadilly trains have lower floors.	倫敦地鐵有部分車站為區域線 (District line) 和皮卡迪利線 (Piccadilly line) 共線營運，其中皮卡迪利線的列車車廂地板較低。
A tram stop is often in the middle of the street; usually it has as a platform a refuge area of a similar height to that of the sidewalk (e.g. 100 mm (3.9 in)), and sometimes has no platform.	輕軌車站通常會位於街道中央，且設有和人行道高度相當的候車月台 (比如 100 公釐 (3.9 英吋)，也有些時候不會設置月台。
The latter requires extra care by passengers and other traffic to avoid accidents.	為避免發生意外，沒有月台的車站會需要特別關注乘客和其他交通工具動向。
Both types of tram stops can be seen in the tram networks of Melbourne and Toronto.	在墨爾本和多倫多的輕軌路網中，這兩種車站都會出現。
Sometimes a tram stop is served by ordinary trams with rather low floors and metro-like light rail vehicles with higher floors, and the tram stop has a dual-height platform, as in Amstelveen, Netherlands.	有時候輕軌車站會有地板較低的普通輕軌電車和像地鐵般地板較高的輕軌列車共同停靠，因而設置了雙重高度月台，比如荷蘭阿姆斯多芬市的輕軌系統。
A train station may be served by heavy-rail and light-rail vehicles with lower floors and have a dual- height platform, as on the RijnGouweLijn in the Netherlands.	列車車站也可能會同時提供重軌列車和輕軌列車停靠，因而設置雙重高度月台，比如荷蘭的 RijnGouweLijn 軌道系統。
Platform types include the bay platform, side platform (also called through platform), split platform and island platform.	月台類型包括有港灣式月台、側式月台 (或穿越式月台)、分離式月台和島式月台。
A bay platform is one at which the track terminates, i.e. a dead-end or siding.	港灣式月台會設置於軌道終點 (也就是軌道前方無路或有壁板遮擋)。
Trains serving a bay platform must reverse in or out.	停靠港灣式月台的列車必須反向進出。
A side platform is the more usual type, alongside tracks where the train arrives from one end and leaves towards the other.	側式月台是較為常見的類型，沿著軌道而建，列車會從月台一端進站，再往月台的另一端離站。
An island platform has through platforms on both sides; it may be indented on one or both ends, with bay platforms.	島式月台設有完整的雙側月台，其中一側或兩側均可內縮改建成港灣式月台
To reach an island platform there may be a bridge, a tunnel, or a level crossing.	為方便乘客前往島式月台，站內可能會設有天橋、地下道或是人行穿越道。
A variant on the side platform is the spanish solution which has platforms on both sides of a single through track.	有一種側式月台稱為西班牙式月台，會在一條直穿而過的軌道兩側設置月台。
Some of the station facilities are often located on the platforms.	月台上通常會有一些車站設施。
Where the platforms are not adjacent to a station building, often some form of shelter or waiting room is provided, and employee cabins may also be present.	通常在並未鄰接車站大樓的月台上會設有某種形式的遮蔽空間或候車室，也有可能會出現員工休息室。
The weather protection offered varies greatly, from little more than a roof with open sides, to a closed room with heating or air-conditioning.	月台上遮風擋雨的設施可謂五花八門，從上有往外延伸的遮棚但兩側開放的候車亭到安裝了暖氣或冷氣的密閉候車室，各具特色。
There may be benches, lighting, ticket counters, drinking fountains, shops, trash boxes, and static timetables or dynamic displays with information about the next train.	月台上可能會有長椅、照明設備、售票機、飲水機、店鋪、垃圾桶，以及負責提供下班列車資訊的靜態時刻表或動態顯示螢幕。
There are often loudspeakers as part of a public address (PA) system.	通常也會架設公共廣播系統 (PA) 的播音喇叭。
The PA system is often used where dynamic timetables or electronic displays are not present.	廣播 (PA) 系統通常會在沒有動態時刻表或電子顯示看板的地方使用。
A variety of information is presented, including destinations and times (for all trains, or only the more important long-distance trains), delays, cancellations, platform changes, changes in routes and destinations, the number of carriages in the train and the location of first class or luggage compartments, and supplementary fee or reservation requirements.	系統會提供各式各樣的資訊，包括列車的目的地和發車時刻 (各級列車或僅提供較為重要的長途列車)、車次延遲、取消、月台變更、路線和目的地變更、列車車廂數量和頭等艙或行李車廂的位置， 以及附加費用或預先劃位需求。
Some metro stations have platform screen doors between the platforms and the tracks.	有些地鐵車站在月台和軌道之間設有月台門。
They provide more safety, and they allow the heating or air conditioning in the station to be separated from the ventilation in the tunnel, thus being more efficient and effective.	這些月台門能讓環境更安全，也可將站內的暖氣或冷氣與隧道內的通風隔開來，藉此強化節能減碳和運轉效能。
They have been installed in most stations of the Singapore MRT and the Hong Kong MTR, and stations on the Jubilee Line Extension in London.	新加坡地鐵和香港地鐵的大部分車站以及倫敦銀禧線延伸段的各車站都安裝了月台門。
Platforms should be sloped upwards slightly towards the platform edge to prevent wheeled objects such as trolleys, prams and wheelchairs from rolling away and into the path of the train.	月台邊緣應該要稍微上揚，避免如手推車、嬰兒車和輪椅等裝有輪子的物品滑落到列車軌道上。
Many platforms have a cavity underneath an overhanging edge so that people who may fall off the platform can seek shelter from incoming trains.	有許多月台在突出的邊緣下方留有空間，讓不慎從月台掉下去的人能夠尋求避難，躲過正在進站的列車。
A dangerous practice is sitting on the edge of the platform, which requires withdrawing the legs fast enough when a train arrives.	坐在月台邊緣十分危險，需要在列車抵達時盡快將雙腿抬起來才行。
In high-speed rail, passing trains are a significant safety problem as the safe distance from the platform edge increases with the speed of the passing train.	在高速鐵路上過站不停的列車是重要的安全問題。過站列車的速度越快，距離月台邊緣的安全距離也會隨之增加。
A study done by the United States Department of Transportation in 1999 found that trains passing station platforms at speeds of 240 kilometres per hour (150 mph) can pose safety concerns to passengers on the platforms who are 2 metres (6.6 ft) away from the edge due to the aerodynamic effects created by pressure and induced airflow with speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph) to 95 kilometres per hour (59 mph) depending on the train body aerodynamic designs.	有一份美國運輸部在 1999 年完成的研究發現，以時速 240 公里 (150 mph) 過站的列車，其氣流壓力所導致的空氣動力學效應會對距離月台邊緣 2 公尺 (6.6 英尺) 的乘造成安全疑慮，並產生速度達到每小時 64 公里 (40 mph) 至每小時 95 公里 (59 mph) 的氣流，其強弱取決於列車車體的空氣動力學設計。
Additionally, the airflow can cause debris to be blown out to the waiting passengers.	此外，氣流會將塵土碎石吹向候車乘客。
If the passengers stand closer at 1 metre (3.3 ft), the risk increases with airflow that can reach speeds of 79 kilometres per hour (49 mph) to 116 kilometres per hour (72 mph).	如果乘客站的位置往前移到 1 公尺處 (3.3 英尺)，那麼會造成風險的氣流速度則為每小時 79 公里 (49 mph) 至每小時 116 公里 (72 mph)。
In United Kingdom, a guideline for platform safety specifies that for the platforms with train passing speeds between 160 kilometres per hour (99 mph) and 200 kilometres per hour (120 mph), there should be a yellow-line buffer zone of 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) and other warning signs.	英國的候車月台安全規章中規定，凡列車通過速度介於每小時 160 公里 (99 mph) 至每小時 200 公里 (120 mph) 之間的候車月台，均應設有寬度達 1.5 公尺 (約 4.9 英尺) 的黃線緩衝區及其他警告標示。
If trains can pass at speeds higher than 200 kilometres per hour (120 mph), the platforms should be inaccessible to passengers unless there are waiting rooms or screened areas to provide protection.	若列車通過速度超過每小時 200 公里 (120 mph)，除非有設置候車室或設有安全屏障的區域，否則應禁止乘客進入該月台空間。
The European Union has a regulation for platforms that are close to tracks with train passing speeds of 250 kilometres per hour (160 mph) or more should not be accessible to passengers unless there is a lower speed limit for trains that intend to stop at the station or there are barriers to limit access.	據歐盟規範，若鄰近軌道上的列車通過速度達到每小時 250 公里 (160 mph) 以上，除非針對會在該站停靠的列車有較低的時速限制或是設有限制通行範圍的障礙物，否則應禁止乘客進入該月台空間。
Platforms usually have some form of warnings or measures to keep passengers away from the tracks.	月台上通常會設有某種形式的警告標示或安全措施，讓乘客遠離軌道。
The simplest measure is markings near the edge of the platform to demarcate the distance back that passengers should remain.	最簡單的措施就是在靠近月台邊緣的地方標示出乘客應該保有的安全距離。
Often a special tiled surface is used as well as a painted line, to help blind people using a walking aid, and help in preventing wheelchairs from rolling too near the platform edge.	通常會使用具有特殊表面的月台磚以及畫線標示，一方面協助盲人使用導盲手杖，另一方面也有助於防止輪椅來到太靠近月台邊緣的位置。
In the US, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 regulations require a detectable warning strip 24 inches (61 cm) wide, consisting of truncated dome bumps in a visually-contrasting color, for the full length of the platform.	據美國於 1990 年頒布的美國身心障礙人士專法 (Americans with Disabilities Act) 規定，觸知警示條的寬度必須為 24 英吋 (約 61 公分)，含有漆上醒目顏色的平頂圓凸，並且長度與月台相等。
Ideally platforms should be straight or slightly convex, so that the guard can see the whole train when preparing to close the doors.	理想的月台形狀應為筆直或略有弧度，好讓月台警衛在準備關閉車門時能夠對列車狀況一覽無遺。
Platforms that have great curvature have blind spots that create a safety hazard.	彎度大的月台會出現造成安全危害的盲點區塊。
Mirrors or closed-circuit cameras may be used in these cases to view the whole platform.	在這種情況下，可使用鏡子或監視攝影機來查看月台全景。
Also passenger carriages are straight, so doors will not always open directly onto a curved platform – often a platform gap is present.	此外，由於列車車廂均為筆直設計，所以車門不一定會貼著彎曲的月台開啟，時常會出現月台間隙。
Usually such platforms will have warning signs, possibly auditory, such as London Underground's famous phrase "Mind the gap".	通常這類月台會設置警告標示，也有可能會透過語音提醒，比如倫敦地鐵著名的警語：「請小心月台間隙」(Mind the gap)。
There may be moveable gap filler sections within the platform, extending once the train has stopped and retracting after the doors have closed.	月台內可能會設有可填補間隙的伸縮踏板，在列車靠站後伸出，然後在車門關閉後縮回。
The New York City Subway employs these at 14th Street–Union Square on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and at Times Square on the 42nd Street Shuttle, and formerly at the South Ferry outer loop station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.	紐約地鐵如今在位於 IRT 萊辛頓大道線 (IRT Lexington Avenue Line) 上的 14 街-聯合廣場車站和位於 42 街接駁線 (42nd Street Shuttle) 上的時代廣場站均設有伸縮踏板，之前則曾在位於 IRT 百老匯-第七大道線 (IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line) 上的南渡船頭外環車站 (South Ferry outer loop station) 設置踏板。
In the UK, recent rules require new platforms to be straight.	英國最近修訂的規範明定新建月台必須為筆直外型。
Flip-flops are a type of sandal, typically worn as a form of casual wear.	人字拖是一種涼鞋，通常是一種休閒服飾。
They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y-shaped strap known as a toe thong that passes between the first and second toes and around both sides of the foot or can be a hard base with a strap across all the toes (these can also be called sliders).	由一個扁平的鞋底組成，一條Y形的帶子鬆散地固定在腳上，稱為腳趾丁字帶，穿過第一和第二腳趾之間以及腳兩側，或者可以是一個硬底座，在所有腳趾上都有一條帶子（這些也可以稱為滑塊）。
This style of footwear has been worn by the people of many cultures throughout the world, originating as early as the ancient Egyptians in 1,500 B.C.	這種鞋類風格一直由世界各地許多文化的人們穿著，最早起源於公元前1500年的古埃及人。
In the United States the flip-flop descends from the Japanese zōri, which became popular after World War II as soldiers brought them back from Japan.	在美國，人字拖起源於日本zōri，二戰後，當士兵從日本帶回來時，日本zōri變得很受歡迎。
They became popular unisex summer footwear starting in the 1960s.	自1960年代開始，人字拖成為流行的中性夏季鞋類。
The term flip-flop has been used in American and British English since the 1960s to describe the thong or no-heel-strap sandal.	自20世紀60年代以來，人字拖一詞在美國和英國英語中一直用於描述丁字鞋或無跟帶涼鞋。
It is an onomatopoeia of the sound made by the sandals when walking in them.	這是穿著涼鞋行走時發出的聲音的擬聲。
They are called thongs (sometimes pluggers) in Australia, jandals (originally a trademarked name derived from "Japanese sandals") in New Zealand, slops or “visplakkies” in South Africa and Zimbabwe, and tsinelas or step-in in the Philippines (or, in some Visayan localities, "smagol", from the word smuggled).	在澳大利亞，它們被稱為丁字鞋（有時是 plugger），在紐西蘭被稱為jandal（最初是源自「日本涼鞋」的商標名稱），在南非和辛巴威被稱為 slope 或「visplakkies」，在菲律賓被稱為「tsinelas」或「step-in」（或者，在米沙鄢群島部分地區，從單字 smuggled 變化為「smagol」）。
This footwear has a number of other names around the world.	這種鞋子在世界各地還有許多其他名字。
The Japanese wear similarly designed, traditional straw sandals known as zōri.	日本人穿著設計相似的傳統草鞋，被稱為zōri。
Throughout the world, they are known by a variety of other names, including dép tông or dép xỏ ngón in Vietnam, chinelos in Brazil, japonki in Poland, dacas in Somalia, sayonares (σαγιονάρες) in Greece, slippers in Hawaii, Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago and the Netherlands, infradito in Italy, djapanki (джапанки) in Bulgaria,"charlie wote" in Ghana, "japanke" in Croatia and vietnamki in Russia and Ukraine, yezenes in Latvia.	在世界各地，它們以各種其他名稱而聞名，包括越南的dép tông或dép xo ngón、巴西的 chinelos、波蘭的 japonki、索馬利亞的 dacas、希臘的 Saonares（σαγιονάρες）、夏威夷、巴哈馬、千里達及托巴哥和荷蘭的 slippers、義大利的 infradito、保加利亞的 djapanki（джапанки）、迦納的「charlie wote」、克羅埃西亞的「japanke」、俄羅斯和烏克蘭的 viernamki、拉脫維亞的 yezenes。

In Greek sandals, the toe strap was worn between the first and second toes, while Roman sandals had the strap between the second and third toes.	希臘的人字拖，腳趾帶是介於大姆指與食指之間，而羅馬版本則置於食指於中指間。
These differ from the sandals worn by the Mesopotamians, with the strap between the third and fourth toes.	美索不達米亞的人字拖又不同於前者，置於中指於無名指間。
In India, a related chappal ("toe knob") sandal was common, with no straps but a small knob sitting between the first and second toes.	印度的 chappal 鞋（指扣鞋）也很普及，沒有趾帶，但有個鈕扣置於第一與第二指間。
They are known as Padukas.	這類鞋子稱為 Padukas。
The modern flip-flop became popular in the United States as soldiers returning from World War II brought Japanese zōri with them.	在美國當代人字拖的流行，源自二次世界大戰返國的士兵，自日本帶回的 zori。
It caught on in the 1950s during the postwar boom and after the end of hostilities of the Korean War.	正好遇上 1950 年代戰後嬰兒潮與韓戰的結束。
As they became adopted into American popular culture, the sandals were redesigned and changed into the bright colors that dominated 1950s design.	在人字拖為美國流行文化接納之時，鞋款重新設計並導入亮眼色彩，是 1950 年代的主流設計風格。
They quickly became popular due to their convenience and comfort, and were popular in beach-themed stores and as summer shoes.	這類鞋種快速普及，因為方便又舒服，在海灘主題商店很常見，當作夏天的涼鞋。
During the 1960s, flip-flops became firmly associated with the beach lifestyle of California.	1960年代，人字拖與加州的海灘生活方式密不可分。
As such, they were promoted as primarily a casual accessory, typically worn with shorts, bathing suits, or summer dresses.	因此，這類鞋在宣傳時主打當作休閒配件，常與短褲、泳裝和夏季服飾搭配。
As they became more popular, some people started wearing them for dressier or more formal occasions.	因為愈來愈普及，也有人開始在時尚或較正式的場合穿人字拖。
In 1962, Alpargatas marketed a version of flip-flops known as Havaianas in Brazil.	1962 年，Alpargatas 公司在巴西推出一種稱為哈瓦仕的人字拖。
By 2010, more than 150 million pairs of Havaianas were produced each year.	到了 2010年，每年要製造超過 1.5 億雙的哈瓦仕。
Flip-flops quickly became popular as casual footwear of young adults.	人字拖在年輕人之間很快成為熱門休閒鞋類。
Girls would often decorate their flip-flops with metallic finishes, charms, chains, beads, rhinestones, or other jewelry.	女生經常會用金屬飾品、鈴鐺、鍊子、珠子、萊茵石、其他珠寶等來裝飾人字拖。
High-end flip-flops made of leather or sophisticated synthetic materials are commonly worn in place of sneakers or loafers as the standard, everyday article of casual footwear, particularly among teenagers and young adults, although it is not unusual to see older people wearing playful, thick-soled flip-flops in brilliant colors.	高級皮製或高級合成材料製成的人字拖，經常在運動或休閒場所當做標準的每日休閒鞋類，特別是在青少年與年輕人間；不過年紀較長的人不太穿這種色彩搶眼的休閒厚底人字拖。
Platform and high-heel variants began to appear in the 1990s.	1990 年代開始出現厚底和高跟版本。
A minor controversy erupted in 2005 when some members of Northwestern University's national champion women's lacrosse team visited the White House wearing flip-flops.	2005 年，因為部分獲得全國冠軍的西北大學女子曲棍球員，在造訪白宮時穿著人字拖，因此引發了小股爭議。

There is still a debate over whether this signaled a fundamental change in American culture — many youth feel that flip-flops are dressier and can be worn in a variety of social contexts, while older generations feel that wearing them at formal occasions signifies laziness and comfort over style.	這事件是否代表美國文化從根改變，仍有爭議；許多年輕人覺得人字拖是種時尚，可在不同社交場合中穿著，而老一輩的人則覺得在正式場合穿著人字拖，突顯這些貪圖方便舒適，不在乎雅觀。
In 2011, while vacationing in his native Hawaii, Barack Obama became the first President of the United States to be photographed wearing a pair of flip-flops.	2011 年，巴拉克・歐巴馬在家鄉夏威夷度假時，成為第一個被拍到穿著人字拖的美國總統。

While exact sales figures for flip-flops are difficult to obtain due to the large number of stores and manufacturers involved, the Atlanta-based company Flip Flop Shops claimed that the shoes were responsible for a $20 billion industry in 2009.	雖然因為有太多商店和製造廠，使得人字拖的精確銷量數字難以取得，但在亞特蘭大的 Flip Flop Shops 說 2009 年的人字拖產值高達 200 億美元。
Furthermore, sales of flip-flops exceeded those of sneakers for the first time in 2006.	更有甚者，2006 年的人字拖銷量超過各類運動鞋。
If these figures are accurate, it is remarkable considering the low cost of most flip-flops.	如果這些數字精確無誤，那就非常可觀，因為大多數人字拖都很便宜。
The modern flip-flop has a very simple design, consisting of a thin rubber sole with two straps running in a Y shape from the sides of the foot to the gap between the big toe and the one beside it.	當代人字拖的設計很簡單，由一個薄橡膠鞋底，配上呈 Y 字型的兩條束帶，從腳板兩側到大姆指與食指中間的縫。
They typically do not have a strap around the heel, although heeled varieties are available, as well as flip-flops designed for sports, which come with added support common to athletic shoes, with the thong between the toes.	腳跟處通常沒有束帶，不過有些變化鞋種有鞋跟，也有專為運動設計的人字拖，在腳趾到腳板間加上常見於運動鞋的加強支撐。
Most modern flip-flops are inexpensive, costing as little as $5 USD, or less in some parts of the world.	大多數的當代人字拖不貴，價格多在 5 美元以下，在世界其他地方還更便宜。
They are made from a wide variety of materials, as were the ancient thong sandals.	製作材質非常多元，就和古代的人字拖一樣。
The modern sandals are made of more modern materials, such as rubber, foam, plastic, leather, suede, and even fabric.	當代的人字拖使用現代的材質，例如橡膠、發泡材質、塑膠、皮革、仿皮，也有用纖維製的。
Thongs made of polyurethane have caused some environmental concerns; because polyurethane is a number 7 resin, they can't be easily discarded, and they persist in landfills for a very long time.	使用聚胺酯製作的鞋面，往往造成環境問題；因為聚胺酯屬於第7類合成品，不可隨意丟棄，且在掩埋場中會持續很長時間無法分解。
In response to these concerns, some companies have begun selling flip-flops made from recycled rubber, such as that from used bicycle tires, or even hemp, and some offer a recycling program for used flip flops.	為了對應這類問題，部分公司開始販售以回收橡膠製成的人字拖，例如使用腳踏車廢胎，甚至使用大麻纖維，也有公司推出回收計畫，回收廢人字拖。
Because of the strap between the toes, flip-flops are typically not worn with socks.	因為在腳趾間會有束帶，所以穿人字拖時通常不穿襪子。
In colder weather, however, some people wear flip-flops with toe socks.	不過天冷時，會有人穿著腳趾襪來穿人字拖。
The Japanese commonly wear tabi, a type of sock with a single slot for the thong, with their zōri.	在日本很普遍的足袋，就是一種可以搭配 zori 穿的單趾襪。
While flip-flops do provide the wearer with some mild protection from hazards on the ground, such as hot sand at the beach, glass, thumb tacks or even fungi and wart-causing viruses in locker rooms or community pools, their simple design is responsible for a host of other injuries of the foot and lower leg.	人字拖雖能提供穿戴者適當的防護，避免他們因踩到海灘上的燙腳沙粒、碎玻璃、圖釘等物品而造成危害，甚或在更衣室或社區泳池感染黴菌和病毒疣，但是其簡樸的設計也會導致足部和小腿等處受到其他傷害。
Walking for long periods in flip-flops can be very tough on the feet, resulting in pain in the ankles, legs, and feet.	穿著人字拖長時間行走可能會讓雙腳十分不適，導致腳踝、腿部和足部疼痛。
A 2009 study at Auburn University found that flip-flop wearers took shorter steps and their heels hit the ground with less vertical force than those wearing athletic shoes.	據奧本大學於 2009 年進行的研究指出，穿著人字拖的人相較於穿著運動鞋的人，前者的行走步距較短且腳跟踩地的垂直作用力也比較弱。
Individuals with flat feet or other foot issues are advised to wear a shoe with better support.	建議有扁平足或其他足部問題的人穿上鞋子，獲得更完善的支撐。
The lack of support provided by thong sandals is thought by some to be a major cause of injuries.	有些人認為缺少支撐的夾腳拖為造成傷害的主要原因之一。
Some flip-flops have a spongy sole, causing the foot to roll further inward than normal when it hits the ground (over-pronation).	有些人字拖的鞋底為海棉材質，導致足部在踩到地面時會過度往內旋轉 (過度內旋)。
Flip-flops can cause a person to overuse the tendons in their feet, resulting in tendonitis.	人字拖會讓人過度使用足部肌腱，進而導致肌腱發炎。
Ankle sprains or broken bones are also common injuries, due to stepping off a curb or tumbling; the ankle bends, but the flip-flop neither holds on to nor supports it.	因為在路緣踩空或絆倒而造成的腳踝扭傷或骨折均為常見傷害。人字拖無法在腳踝扭轉時妥善保護或給予支撐。
The straps of the flip-flop may cause frictional issues, such as rubbing, during walking.	人字拖的綁帶會導致摩擦力問題，例如在行走時磨到腳。
The open-toed nature of the thongs may result in cuts, scrapes, bruises, or stubbed toes.	人字拖會讓腳趾露出來，可能因此造成割傷、刮傷、挫傷或踢傷等問題。
Despite all of these issues, flip-flops do not have to be avoided completely.	儘管會有這些問題出現，但我們也不必完全避開人字拖。
Many podiatrists recommend avoiding the inexpensive, drug store varieties and spending more on sandals with thick-cushioned soles, as well as ones that have a strap that's not canvas and that comes back almost to the ankle.	有許多足科醫師建議避免購買廉價的藥妝店款式，而是多花些錢去購買厚底且有軟墊的涼鞋，並附有非帆布材質且位置十分接近腳踝的綁帶。
A paper clip (or sometimes paperclip) is a device used to hold sheets of paper together, usually made of steel wire bent to a looped shape (though some are covered in plastic).	迴紋針是用來將紙張夾在一起的文具用品，通常是將金屬線彎折成迴圈狀來製作而成 (不過有些會包上一層塑膠膜)。
Most paper clips are variations of the Gem type introduced in the 1890s or earlier, characterized by the almost two full loops made by the wire.	大多數的迴紋針都是從在 1890 年代之前問世的寶石 (Gem) 牌迴紋針演變而來，其特色為將金屬線彎折成近乎完整的兩個迴圈。
Common to paper clips proper is their utilization of torsion and elasticity in the wire, and friction between wire and paper.	通常迴紋針所運用的是金屬本身的扭轉力和彈力，以及金屬和紙張之間的摩擦力。
When a moderate number of sheets are inserted between the two "tongues" of the clip, the tongues will be forced apart and cause torsion in the bend of the wire to grip the sheets together.	當迴紋針的雙「舌」之間塞入了相當數量的紙張後，會迫使這兩片針舌分開並導致金屬在彎折過後產生扭轉力，進而將這些紙張牢牢夾在一起。
Paper clips usually have an oblong shape with straight sides, but may also be triangular or circular, or have more elaborate shapes.	迴紋針通常會是兩側筆直的長橢圓形，不過也會出現三角形或圓形，或是更加精心設計的形狀。
The most common material is steel or some other metal, but moulded plastic is also used.	最常使用的材質為鋼鐵或其他金屬，不過也有使用塑膠壓製而成。
Some other kinds of paper clip use a two-piece clamping system.	有些其他種類的迴紋針會使用雙片鉗夾設計。
Recent innovations include multi-colored plastic-coated paper clips and spring-fastened binder clips.	近日來的創新發展包括了七彩繽紛的塑膠包膜迴紋針以及彈簧固定式活頁夾。
According to the Early Office Museum, the first patent for a bent wire paper clip was awarded in the United States to Samuel B. Fay in 1867.	根據昔日辦公博物館 (Early Office Museum) 的資料顯示，金屬彎折迴紋針的第一份專利是由美國於 1867 年授予 Samuel B. Fay。
This clip was originally intended primarily for attaching tickets to fabric, although the patent recognized that it could be used to attach papers together.	儘管這份專利認可它能用來把紙夾在一起，但其實這枚迴紋針原本主要是用來把票券夾在衣服上。
Fay received U.S. patent 64,088 on April 23, 1867.	Fay 於 1867 年 4 月 23 日獲得美國第 64088 號專利。
Although functional and practical, Fay's design along with the 50 other designs patented prior to 1899 are not considered reminiscent of the modern paperclip design known today.	Fay 的設計以及在 1899 年之前的另外 50 項專利設計儘管都十分實用且務實，但其實都不太會讓人聯想到今日廣為人知的現代版迴紋針設計。
Another notable paper clip design was also patented in the United States by Erlman J. Wright in 1877.	另一款引人注目的迴紋針設計，則是由 Erlman J. Wright 在 1877 年獲得美國專利認可。
This clip was advertised at that time for use in fastening newspapers.	這款迴紋針在當時是以其能夠扣緊報紙來打廣告。
The most common type of wire paper clip still in use, the Gem paper clip, was never patented, but it was most likely in production in Britain in the early 1870s by "The Gem Manufacturing Company", according to the American expert on technological innovations, Professor Henry J. Petroski.	目前最常見且一直還有人使用的金屬線圈迴紋針 (即寶石牌迴紋針) 反而從未獲得專利。據美國的科技創新專家 Henry J. Petroski 教授表示，這款迴紋針很有可能是在 1870 年代早期，由英國的「寶石公司」負責製造生產。
He refers to an 1883 article about "Gem Paper-Fasteners", praising them for being "better than ordinary pins" for "binding together papers on the same subject, a bundle of letters, or pages of a manuscript".	他引述了一篇 1883 年關於「寶石牌紙夾」的文章，文內盛讚這款紙夾「比一般的別針更好用」，能夠「將內容主題相同的紙張、一堆信件或是好幾頁手稿夾在一起」。
Since the 1883 article had no illustration of this early "Gem", it may have been different from modern paper clips of that name.	因為這篇 1883 年的文章並未附上這款早年的「寶石牌」的示意圖，所以可能會跟現代所謂的迴紋針有所差異。
The earliest illustration of its current form is in an 1893 advertisement for the "Gem Paper Clip".	最早繪製出其目前樣式的示意圖，出現在 1893 年的「寶石牌迴紋針」廣告文宣中。
In 1904 Cushman & Denison registered a trademark for the "Gem" name in connection with paper clips.	1904 年，Cushman & Denison 註冊了與迴紋針有關的「寶石牌」商標。
The announcement stated that it had been used since March 1, 1892, which may have been the time of its introduction in the United States.	這份公告表明了這項商標在 1892 年 3 月 1 日之前都還沒有人用過，也可能就是在這個時候來引進到美國境內。
Paper clips are still sometimes called "Gem clips", and in Swedish the word for any paper clip is "gem".	迴紋針現在有時候還是會被稱作是「寶石夾」。在瑞典文中，迴紋針的通稱即為「寶石」。
Definite proof that the modern type of paper clip was well known in 1899 at the latest, is the patent granted to William Middlebrook of Waterbury, Connecticut on April 27 of that year for a "Machine for making wire paper clips." The drawing clearly shows that the product is a perfect clip of the Gem type.	目前能確切證明現代款式的迴紋針最晚在 1899 年就廣為人知的證據，為那一年 4 月 27 日於康乃狄克州的瓦特柏利授予 William Middlebrook 的「金屬線圈迴紋針製造機」專利。圖中能清楚看見這台機器製造出寶石牌款式的精美迴紋針。
The fact that Middlebrook did not mention it by name, suggests that it was already well known at the time.	Middlebrook 當時並未提及品牌名稱，由此可見這款迴紋針在那個時候已經廣為人知。
Since then countless variations on the same theme have been patented.	自此之後，由相同主題款式演變出來的各種設計都陸續獲得專利認可。
Some have pointed instead of rounded ends, some have the end of one loop bent slightly to make it easier to insert sheets of paper, and some have wires with undulations or barbs to get a better grip.	有些採用尖頭設計取代圓頭設計，有些會稍微彎折一下其中一個迴圈的尾端，使其更容易夾入紙張，有些則會將金屬線彎折成波浪形或倒鉤狀，讓它能夾得更緊。
In addition, purely aesthetic variants have been patented, clips with triangular, star, or round shapes.	除此之外，純粹追求美感呈現的不同設計也獲得了專利，比如三角形、星形或圓形的迴紋針。
But the original Gem type has for more than a hundred years proved to be the most practical, and consequently by far the most popular.	不過，原始的寶石牌款式則風行了超過百年之久，在在證明它是最實用且持續穩坐人氣寶座的王者。
Its qualities—ease of use, gripping without tearing, and storing without tangling—have been difficult to improve upon.	它的品質 (方便使用、緊扣而不怕撕裂，且儲存時不會相互勾纏) 已經好到難以再多做改良了。
National Paperclip Day is May 29.	5 月 29 日是全國迴紋針日。
It has been claimed, though apparently without evidence, that Herbert Spencer, the originator of the term "survival of the fittest", invented the paper clip.	儘管沒有確切證據足以證明，但據說當年是曾寫下「適者生存」的 Herbert Spencer 發明了迴紋針。
Spencer claimed in his autobiography to have invented a "binding-pin" that was distributed by Ackermann & Company, and he shows a drawing of the pin in his Appendix I (following Appendix H).	Spencer 在他的自傳中宣稱自己發明了一款由阿克曼公司 (Ackermann & Company) 負責分銷的「裝訂別針」，而且他還在附錄 I (在附錄 H 的後面) 中附上了圖稿。
This pin looked more like a modern cotter pin than a modern paper clip, but it was designed to hold sheets of paper together.	這款別針看起來比較像是現代的髮夾而非迴紋針，不過它原先的設計就是用來將紙張夾在一起。
It is approximately 15 cm unfolded.	展開來約莫有 15 公分長。
A Norwegian, Johan Vaaler (1866–1910), has erroneously been identified as the inventor of the paper clip.	挪威的 Johan Vaaler (1866–1910) 向來被誤認為是迴紋針的發明者。
He was granted patents in Germany and in the United States (1901) for a paper clip of similar design, but less functional and practical, because it lacked the last turn of the wire.	他在德國和美國 (1901 年) 都曾以類似設計的迴紋針獲得專利認可，不過相較之下不太實用，金屬線的部分也少了最後的扭轉收尾。
Vaaler probably did not know that a better product was already on the market, although not yet in Norway.	Vaaler 大概並不知道市面上已經有更優質的產品，儘管當時也尚未引進到挪威。
His version was never manufactured and never marketed, because the superior Gem was already available.	他的版本從未生產製造也從未在市面上販售，因為當時已經有穩佔上風的寶石牌了。
Long after Vaaler's death his countrymen created a national myth based on the false assumption that the paper clip was invented by an unrecognised Norwegian genius.	在 Vaaler 過世了好一陣子之後，他的同鄉創造出一個流傳全國的民間傳說，誤稱迴紋針是由一位籍籍無名的挪威天才所發明。
Norwegian dictionaries since the 1950s have mentioned Vaaler as the inventor of the paper clip, and that myth later found its way into international dictionaries and much of the international literature on paper clips.	自 1950 年代以降的挪威辭典都說 Vaaler 是迴紋針的發明人，而且這則民間傳說之後還被納入國際辭典和諸多有關迴紋針的國際文獻。
Vaaler probably succeeded in having his design patented abroad, despite the previous existence of more useful paper clips, because patent authorities at that time were quite liberal and rewarded any marginal modification of existing inventions.	儘管當時早就存在更實用的迴紋針，但 Vaaler 大概還是順利以自己的設計獲得了海外專利，因為那時候的專利認證機構相當自由開放，且會獎勵各種針對現有發明稍作修改的成果。
Johan Vaaler began working for Alfred J. Bryns Patentkontor in Kristiania in 1892 and was later promoted to office manager, a position he held until his death.	Johan Vaaler 於 1892 年開始受僱於奧斯陸的 Alfred J. Bryns 專利工程師，並在之後晉升為經理，一路做到他逝世為止。
As the employee of a patent office, he could easily have obtained a patent in Norway.	身為專利辦公室的職員，他可以輕易在挪威獲得專利認可。
His reasons for applying abroad are not known; it is possible that he wanted to secure the commercial rights internationally.	至於他為何要申請海外專利，不得而知。有可能是他想要維護在國際上進行商業貿易的權利。
Also, he may have been aware that a Norwegian manufacturer would find it difficult to introduce a new invention abroad, starting from the small home market.	此外，他可能有注意到從小家庭市場起家的挪威製造商會難以將新發明推廣到海外市場。
Vaaler's patents expired quietly, while the "Gem" was used worldwide, including his own country.	Vaaler 的專利在悄無聲息間過了期，「寶石牌」則風行世界各地，包含了他自己的家鄉。
The failure of his design was its impracticality.	他的設計錯誤在於其並不實用。
Without the two full loops of the fully developed paper clip, it was difficult to insert sheets of paper into his clip.	由於少了研發完善的迴紋針所擁有的兩個完整迴圈，紙張難以夾進他的迴紋針。
One could manipulate the end of the inner wire so that it could receive the sheet, but the outer wire was a dead end because it could not exploit the torsion principle.	雖然我們可以調整一下內側的金屬線，讓紙比較好夾進去，但外側的金屬線卻讓人束手無策，因為這款迴紋針無法利用到扭轉原理。
The clip would instead stand out like a keel, perpendicular to the sheet of paper.	這款迴紋針反而會像是脊椎般將紙張垂直撐起來。
The impracticality of Vaaler's design may easily be demonstrated by cutting off the last outer loop and one long side from a regular Gem clip.	只要切掉寶石牌迴紋針的外圈和一段長邊，就能輕易展示 Vaaler 的設計有多不實用。
The originator of the Norwegian paper clip myth was an engineer of the Norwegian national patent agency who visited Germany in the 1920s to register Norwegian patents in that country.	挪威發明迴紋針的民間傳說起源自一位挪威的國家專利代理人。他為了在德國登記註冊挪威的海外專利，在 1920 年代造訪了德國。
He came across Vaaler's patent, but failed to detect that it was not the same as the then-common Gem-type clip.	他翻閱到 Vaaler 的專利認證，卻未能察覺這和當時常見的寶石牌迴紋針並不相同。
In the report of the first fifty years of the patent agency, he wrote an article in which he proclaimed Vaaler to be the inventor of the common paper clip.	在所任職的專利代理機構的五十週年報告書中，他宣稱 Vaaler 發明了日常所見的迴紋針。
This piece of information found its way into some Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II.	這一段話在第二次世界大戰之後被收錄到某些挪威的百科全書當中。
Events of that war contributed greatly to the mythical status of the paper clip.	那場世界大戰讓關於迴紋針的神秘傳說更加甚囂塵上。
Patriots wore them in their lapels as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi authorities when other signs of resistance, such as flag pins or pins showing the cipher of the exiled King Haakon VII of Norway were forbidden.	由於鑲有旗幟的別針和暗指被迫流亡的挪威哈康七世的別針都陸續遭禁，愛國人士紛紛將迴紋針別在制服衣領上，當作抵禦侵佔國土的德軍和納粹政權的象徵。
Those wearing them did not yet see them as national symbols, as the myth of their Norwegian origin was not commonly known at the time.	當時那些配戴迴紋針的愛國人士並未將其視為國族象徵，因為關於其起源自挪威的傳說尚未廣泛流傳。
The clips were meant to denote solidarity and unity ("we are bound together").	迴紋針在當時代表著團結一心 (「我們彼此牢牢扣在一起」)。
The wearing of paper clips was soon prohibited, and people wearing them could risk severe punishment.	配戴迴紋針的行為很快就遭到禁止，並祭出嚴厲處分。
The leading Norwegian encyclopedia mentioned the role of the paper clip as a symbol of resistance in a supplementary volume in 1952, but did not yet proclaim it a Norwegian invention.	首屈一指的挪威百科全書在 1952 年的增補本中提到了迴紋針是抵禦外侮的象徵，但是並未宣稱其為挪威發明的產物。
That information was added in later editions.	挪威發明等言詞則是在之後的版本才加了進去。
According to the 1974 edition, the idea of using the paper clip to denote resistance originated in France.	根據 1974 年版的內文，使用迴紋針來表示抵禦決心的做法起源自法國。
A clip worn on a lapel or front pocket could be seen as "deux gaules" (two posts or poles) and be interpreted as a reference to the leader of the French Resistance, General Charles de Gaulle.	配戴在衣領或前胸口袋的迴紋針看起來猶如「雙柱」或「雙桿」 (法語為「deux gaules」，音似「戴高樂」)，可視為意指法國抵抗運動的領導人，查爾斯戴高樂將軍。
The post-war years saw a widespread consolidation of the paper clip as a national symbol.	在大戰結束後的數年間，將迴紋針當做國族象徵的想法廣為流傳且深植民心。
Authors of books and articles on the history of Norwegian technology eagerly seized it to make a thin story more substantial.	許多撰寫挪威科技史相關書籍和文章的作者抓緊機會大書特書，讓原本內容單薄的故事更加充實且豐富。
They chose to overlook the fact that Vaaler's clip was not the same as the fully developed Gem-type clip.	他們選擇忽視 Vaaler 的迴紋針與研發完善的寶石牌迴紋針並不相同的事實。
In 1989 a giant paper clip, almost 7 m (23 ft) high, was erected on the campus of a commercial college near Oslo in honour of Vaaler, ninety years after his invention was patented. But this monument shows a Gem-type clip, not the one patented by Vaaler.	1989 年，一座將近 7 公尺 (23 英尺) 高的巨大迴紋針聳立在鄰近奧斯陸的一間商學院校園中，為了紀念 Vaaler 的發明榮獲專利認可滿九十週年。不過這座紀念碑的造型卻是寶石牌迴紋針，而非 Vaaler 當年取得專利的樣式。
The celebration of the alleged Norwegian origin of the paper clip culminated in 1999, one hundred years after Vaaler submitted his application for a German patent.	1999 年，在 Vaaler 完成提交德國專利申請的百年之後，關於挪威發明迴紋針的傳聞的慶祝聲勢達到最高峰。
A commemorative stamp was issued that year, the first in a series to draw attention to Norwegian inventiveness.	那一年發行了一款紀念郵票，就此展開一系列宣揚挪威發明實力的活動。
The background shows a facsimile of the German "Patentschrift".	郵票背景為那份德國「專利說明書」的複本。
However, the figure in the foreground is not the paper clip depicted on that document, but the much better known "Gem".	然而前面的圖案卻不是在那份專利說明書中描繪的迴紋針，而是更廣為人知的「寶石牌」。
In 2005, the national biographical encyclopedia of Norway (Norsk biografisk leksikon) published the biography of Johan Vaaler, stating he was the inventor of the paper clip.	2005 年，挪威的國家人物傳記百科全書出版了 Johan Vaaler 的個人傳記，稱其為迴紋針的發明人。
Wire is versatile in its nature.	金屬線本身就具有多元用途。
Thus a paper clip is a useful accessory in many kinds of mechanical work including computer work: the metal wire can be unfolded with a little force.	因此，迴紋針在諸多機械作業中都是相當實用的配件，包括電腦作業：金屬線只要稍加施力就能展開。
Several devices call for a very thin rod to push a recessed button which the user might only rarely need.	有許多儀器裝置需要極為細小的長桿來壓下陷進去外殼裡的按鈕。使用者平常鮮少需要接觸到這顆按鈕。
This is seen on most CD-ROM drives as an "emergency eject" should the power fail; also on early floppy disk drives (including the early Macintosh).	這顆按鈕，在大多數的光碟機上是會在電源失常時用到的「緊急退出」鈕。這也會出現在早期的軟碟機上 (包括早期的麥金塔電腦)。
Various smartphones require the use of a long thin object such as a paper clip to eject the SIM card and some Palm PDAs advise the use of a paper clip to reset the device.	有各式各樣的智慧型手機需要使用如迴紋針般的細長的物件來退出 SIM 卡，也有些 Palm PDA 裝置會建議使用迴紋針來重新設定裝置。
The track ball can be removed from early Logitech pointing devices using a paper clip as the key to the bezel.	早期的羅技滑鼠裝置會使用迴紋針來打開檔板，藉此取出軌跡球。
A paper clip bent into a "U" can be used to start an ATX PSU without connecting it to a motherboard (connect the green to a black on the motherboard header).	彎折成「U」字形的迴紋針可以用來在未實際連接到主機板的狀況下開啟 ATX PSU (將綠線連接到主機板接頭的黑線)。
One or more paper clips can make a loopback device for a RS232 interface (or indeed many interfaces).	單枚或多枚迴紋針可以用來製作適用於 RS232 介面 (或是其他諸多介面) 的迴環裝置。
A paper clip could be installed in a Commodore 1541 disk-drive as a flexible head-stop.	迴紋針可以安裝在 Commodore 1541 磁碟機中，當成具有彈性的磁頭停桿。
A paper clip can be used (unsafely) to temporarily bridge a blown fuse.	迴紋針可以暫時用來銜接熔斷絲 (但並不安全)。
The steel wire from a paperclip can be used in dentistry to form a dental post.	牙科可以使用迴紋針的金屬線來做成牙釘。
Paper clips can be bent into a crude but sometimes effective lock picking device.	迴紋針可以彎折成簡陋但有時候還挺有用的開鎖工具。
Some types of handcuffs can be unfastened using paper clips.	有些類型的手銬可以用迴紋針解開。
There are two approaches.	解鎖方法有兩種。
The first one is to unfold the clip in a line and then twist the end in a right angle, trying to imitate a key and using it to lift the lock fixator.	第一種是先將迴紋針扳直成一條線，然後將一端扭成適合的折角，用來仿照鑰匙將鎖頭的固定榫撬開。
The second approach, which is more feasible but needs some practice, is to use the semi-unfolded clip kink for lifting when the clip is inserted through the hole where the handcuffs are closed.	第二種方法較為可行，但需要多練習個幾次，那就是將展開一半的迴紋針插入手銬閉鎖處的孔隙，然後試著將它撬開。
A paper clip image is the standard image for an attachment in an email client.	迴紋針圖案是在電子郵件客戶端用來表示附件的標準圖案。
In 1994, the US imposed anti-dumping tariffs against China, on paper clips.	1994 年，美國針對從中國進口的迴紋針課徵反傾銷關稅。
The Band-Aid was invented in 1920 by a Johnson & Johnson employee, Earle Dickson in Highland Park, New Jersey for his wife Josephine, who frequently cut and burned herself while cooking.	Band-Aid OK 繃是由嬌生公司 (Johnson & Johnson) 的員工於 1920 年所發明。這位員工是住在紐澤西州高地公園的 Earle Dickson，他為了經常在煮飯時切到或燙到自己的妻子 Josephine 發明了這項產品。
The prototype allowed her to dress her wounds without assistance.	這款 OK 繃的原型能夠讓她自行處理自己的傷口。
Dickson passed the idea on to his employer, which went on to produce and market the product as the Band-Aid.	Dickson 將這個點子遞交給他的主管，隨後就進行量產，並以 Band-Aid 做為產品名稱在市場上販售。
Dickson had a successful career at Johnson & Johnson, rising to vice president before his retirement in 1957.	Dickson 在嬌生公司的職涯一帆風順，於 1957 年退休之前晉升為副總裁。
Perhaps a curiosity, the word "Band" in German means tape.	補充一個小知識，「Band」這個字在德文中有「膠帶」之意。
The original Band-Aids were handmade and not very popular.	原版的 Band-Aid OK 繃是以手工製成，在當時並未受到歡迎。
By 1924, Johnson & Johnson introduced machine-made Band-Aids and began the sale of sterilized Band-Aids in 1939.	到了 1924 年，嬌生公司推出由機器製成的 Band-Aid OK 繃，並於 1939 年開始銷售無菌版 OK 繃。
In 1951, the first decorative Band-Aids were introduced.	1951 年，第一款具有圖案裝飾的 Band-Aid OK 繃正式問世。
They continue to be a commercial success, with such themes as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Oliver & Jenny, Superman, Spider-Man, Rocket Power, Rugrats, smiley faces, Barbie, Dora the Explorer, Batman and Duck Dynasty.	這類 OK 繃的銷售業績持續長紅，相繼推出米老鼠、唐老鴨、《奧麗華歷險記》(Oliver & Jenny)、超人、蜘蛛人、《火箭動力》(Rocket Power)、《淘氣小兵兵》(Rugrats)、笑臉圖案、芭比娃娃、《愛探險的朵拉》(Dora the Explorer)、蝙蝠俠和《鴨子王朝》(Duck Dynasty) 等聯名主題款式。
In World War II, millions were shipped overseas, helping popularize the product.	在二次大戰期間，有上百萬片 OK 繃被運送到海外，助長了這項產品的銷售人氣。
Since then, Johnson & Johnson currently has estimated a sale of over 100 billion Band-Aids worldwide.	自此之後，據嬌生公司估算，目前 Band-Aid OK 繃已經在全球銷售超過千億片。
Johnson & Johnson continues to defend the Band-Aid trademark against it being genericized.	嬌生公司至今持續力守 Band-Aid 這個商標，不讓它成為通用名稱。
Band-Aid arguably has, over time, become a genericized trademark in the United States, and a generic term cannot function as a trademark; but Johnson & Johnson has registered Band-Aid as a trademark on the Principal Register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and the registration is valid and legal.	「Band-Aid」一詞隨著時間的推移，至今可說是美國境內的通用商標，成為不具有專用商標資格的通俗名稱。但嬌生公司其實已經在美國專利商標局的主要註冊簿上將 Band-Aid 註冊為專用商標，而且該項註冊至今仍有效且合法。
A registration on the Principal Register does not create ownership rights under the laws of the United States, and a registration may be challenged and removed if the challenger proves as a matter of fact that the alleged trademark has become generic.	根據美國的相關法律規範，在主要註冊簿上註冊商標並不等同於具有該商標的所有權。如果有人對某個註冊商標提出異議，並提供事實證明該商標已經成為通用名稱，則該註冊商標有可能會遭到質疑或移除。
To protect the name, their trademark, Johnson & Johnson always refers to its products as "BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages", not just "Band-Aid".	嬌生公司為保護自身商標權益，一律將這項產品稱為「BAND-AID® 牌黏性繃帶」，而非只是「Band-Aid」。
The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on 17 December 1997.	「網路日誌」(weblog) 一詞是由 Jorn Barger 於 1997 年 12 月 17 日創造出來。
The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.	簡短版的「網誌 (blog，或譯為部落格)」則是由 Peter Merholz 創造出來。他在 1999 年的 4 月或 5 月在其部落格「Peterme.com」的側邊攔將「weblog」拆解成「we」和「blog」，想開個小玩笑。
Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.	沒過多久，Pyra Labs 公司的 Evan Williams 將「blog」用來當作名詞和動詞 (「to blog」意即「編輯或張貼某人的網誌內容」)，並且想出了「blogger」(部落客) 一詞來和 Pyra Labs 的部落客產品相連結，引領這些詞彙風行全球。
Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms including Usenet, commercial online services such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail lists, and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).	在經營部落格成為顯學之間就已經有出現了許多不同形式的數位社群，包括 Usenet、專營線上商業服務的的 GEnie、位元資訊交換 (BIX)，以及早年的 CompuServe、電子郵件清單和電子佈告欄系統 (BBS)。
In the 1990s, Internet forum software created running conversations with "threads".	到了 1990 年代，網路論壇軟體以「討論串」建立了持續談論的對話形式。
Threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual "corkboard".	討論串為在虛擬「留言板」上依個別主題相互連結成串的訊息。
From 14 June 1993, Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their "What’s New" list of new websites, updated daily and archived monthly.	馬賽克通訊公司 (Mosaic Communications Corporation) 從 1993 年 6 月 14 日開始維護其「What’s New」新建網站清單，定期每日更新且每月建檔封存。
The page was accessible by a special "What's New" button in the Mosaic web browser.	該清單頁面可以透過按下 Mosaic 網路瀏覽器中的「What's New」按鈕前往。
The earliest instance of a commercial blog was on the first business to consumer Web site created in 1995 by Ty, Inc., which featured a blog in a section called "Online Diary".	最早期的商業部落格實例出現在 Ty, Inc. 公司於 1995 年首度建立的企業對消費者 (B2C) 商務網站上，主打名為「線上日誌」的部落格專區。
The entries were maintained by featured Beanie Babies that were voted for monthly by Web site visitors.	網站訪客會在每月票選出特級豆豆娃娃 (Beanie Babies)，負責維護部落格項目。
The modern blog evolved from the online diary where people would keep a running account of the events in their personal lives.	現代的部落格是由線上日誌演變而來。當時的人們會在日誌中記錄個人生活中各種大小事的流水帳。
Most such writers called themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers.	這些作者大多稱呼自己為日記作者、日誌作家或日誌寫手。
Justin Hall, who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at Swarthmore College, is generally recognized as one of the earlier bloggers, as is Jerry Pournelle.	Justin Hall 從 1994 年開始寫作個人部落格，當時他還在就讀斯沃斯莫爾學院。他和 Jerry Pournelle 都是公認的元老級部落客。
Dave Winer's Scripting News is also credited with being one of the older and longer running weblogs.	Dave Winer 的《編撰新聞》(Scripting News) 也被譽為網誌界的長青樹。
The Australian Netguide magazine maintained the Daily Net News on their web site from 1996.	澳洲的《網路指南》(Netguide) 雜誌從 1996 年開始維護自家網站上的《網路日報》(Daily Net News)。
Daily Net News ran links and daily reviews of new websites, mostly in Australia.	《網路日報》負責運作新網站的連結與提供每日評論，其中大多數為澳洲網站。
Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person's personal life combining text, digital video, and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994.	《穿戴式無線網路攝影機》(Wearable Wireless Webcam) 是另一個元老級部落格。這是於 1994 年創立的線上共享日誌，可透過穿戴式電腦和 EyeTap 智慧眼鏡裝置將數位影片和數位照片即時傳送到網站，並結合文字分享個人生活。
This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters.	這種結合了實拍影片和文字的半自動部落格實作在當時被稱為「逆向監視」(sousveillance)，而且像這樣的日誌內容也會用來在法律訴訟中做為證據。
Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a zine, before the term blog entered common usage.	在人們普遍使用「部落格」一詞之前，其實有些早期的部落客 (比如從 1997 年開始經營《厭世妖姬》(The Misanthropic Bitch) 的部落客) 會稱呼自己的線上寫作內容為「小誌」(zine)。
Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites.	早期的部落格就只是在一般網站上使用手動更新的元件。
In 1995, the "Online Diary" on the Ty, Inc. Web site was produced and updated manually before any blogging programs were available.	1995 年，當時還沒有任何部落格程式，Ty, Inc. 公司網站上的「線上日誌」是採手動方式產出與更新內容。
Posts were made to appear in reverse chronological order by manually updating text based HTML code using FTP software in real time several times a day.	一天要使用好幾次 FTP 軟體來手動即時更新 HTML 文字編碼，讓貼文以反向時序呈現。
To users, this offered the appearance of a live diary that contained multiple new entries per day.	對使用者來說，這樣會讓日記看起來猶如生活實況，每天都會新增多篇文章。
At the beginning of each new day, new diary entries were manually coded into a new HTML file, and the start of each month, diary entries were archived into its own folder which contained a separate HTML page for every day of the month.	每一天的第一件事就是手動將新的日記文章編碼匯入新的 HTML 檔案，然後在每個月的一開始將日記文章封存到專屬資料夾內。資料夾中收藏了該月份每一天的個別 HTML 頁面。
Then menus that contained links to the most recent diary entry were updated manually throughout the site.	接著會手動更新網站上所有內含最近日記文章連結的選單。
This text-based method of organizing thousands of files served as a springboard to define future blogging styles that were captured by blogging software developed years later.	這種運用文字編碼來整理上千個檔案的方式，成為往後部落格樣式的定義基礎，並為數年之後研發出來的部落格軟體所用。
The evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger and less technically-inclined population.	電子和軟體工具與時俱進，有助於產出與維護以反向時序張貼的網頁文章，讓更多對於相關技術並不熟悉的民眾得以順利透過程序發表文章。
Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today.	最後，我們如今所熟悉且特有的線上部落格發表型態，於焉誕生。
For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging".	例如，使用某些瀏覽器軟體來「寫部落格」，現在已蔚為典型。
Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services, on regular web hosting services, or run using blog software.	部落格可以交託給專門的定期網路託管服務，或是使用部落格軟體來經營。
An early milestone in the rise in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.	部落格越來越受到重視，並於 2002 年迎來早期的里程碑，當時有許多部落客都在關注美國參議院多數黨領袖 Trent Lott 的發言。
Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president.	Lott 參議員為擁護美國參議員 Strom Thurmond 的派系成員，他盛讚 Thurmond 參議員為能讓美國更加茁壯強大的總統人選。
Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign.	Lott 的批評者則將這些言論視為他默許 Thurmond 於 1948 年競選總統時主張的種族隔離政策。
This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers.	這項觀點在部落客挖掘出來的文件和訪談影片中得到進一步證實。
(See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.)	(請參閱 Josh Marshall 的《論點備忘錄》(Talking Points Memo) 部落格。)
Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story.	雖然 Lott 是在有媒體在場的公開場合發言，主流媒體卻對他的爭議性言論隻字未提，直到有部落格爆料這件事。
Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.	在部落格推波助瀾之下，這場政治危機迫使 Lott 卸下多數黨領袖一職。
Similarly, blogs were among the driving forces behind the "Rathergate" scandal.	同樣，部落格也是讓「拉瑟門」(Rathergate) 醜聞攤上檯面的一大功臣。
To wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather presented documents (on the CBS show 60 Minutes) that conflicted with accepted accounts of President Bush's military service record.	事情是這樣的：(電視新聞主播) 丹拉瑟 (在 CBS 電視台的《60 分鐘》節目上) 公開了幾份文件，其內容與先前眾所周知的布希總統服役紀錄有所矛盾。
Bloggers declared the documents to be forgeries and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view.	有些部落客宣稱這些文件均屬偽造，並提出證據和論述來支持自身看法。
Consequently, CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see Little Green Footballs).	結果，CBS 電視台為其報導技巧欠缺專業素養公開致歉 (請參閱《小巧綠足球》(Little Green Footballs) 部落格)。
Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a news source and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.	有許多部落客將這件醜聞視為大眾媒體接受部落格的起始點。媒體會將部落格當成新聞來源、意見表述以及施加政治壓力的方法。
The impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination.	在這些事件的影響之下，部落格成為更具可信度的新聞傳播媒介。
Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead.	雖然部落客經常會被當成受黨派操弄的輿論工具，有時候卻能在主流媒體不得不遵從上級指示時，搶先讓關鍵資訊曝光。
More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media.	不過，新建立的部落格反而更常會對主流媒體已經發佈的新聞來做出回應。
Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis.	與此同時，有越來越多各界專家開設部落格，讓部落格成為深度分析的資料來源。
In Russia, some political bloggers have started to challenge the dominance of official, overwhelmingly pro-government media.	在俄國，有些政論部落客開始挑戰影響力鋪天蓋地的官媒和親政府媒體。
Bloggers such as Rustem Adagamov and Alexei Navalny have many followers and the latter's nickname for the ruling United Russia party as the "party of crooks and thieves" has been adopted by anti-regime protesters.	Rustem Adagamov 和 Alexei Navalny 都是有許多人追蹤的部落客，後者還把執政的統一俄羅斯黨稱為「騙子和小偷黨」，反政府的示威團體後來也採用了這個綽號。
This led to the Wall Street Journal calling Navalny "the man Vladimir Putin fears most" in March 2012.	這讓《華爾街日報》(Wall Street Journal) 於 2012 年 3 月將 Navalny 冠上「普丁最害怕的男人」的稱號。
By 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as political consultants, news services, and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming.	到了 2004 年，部落格逐漸躋身主流媒體行列，政治顧問、通訊社和候選人紛紛開始使用部落格做為拓展人脈和形塑意見的工具。
Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs' role as a news source.	政治人物和候選人會成立部落格來針對戰爭及其他議題表達意見，鞏固了部落格做為新聞來源的角色定位。
(See Howard Dean and Wesley Clark.) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the UK's Labour Party's MP Tom Watson, began to blog to bond with constituents.	(請見 Howard Dean 和 Wesley Clark)。就連平時不常主動舉辦競選活動的政治人物 (比如英國勞工黨籍國會議員 Tom Watson) 都開始成立部落格，和選民密切聯繫
In January 2005, Fortune magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people "could not ignore": Peter Rojas, Xeni Jardin, Ben Trott, Mena Trott, Jonathan Schwartz, Jason Goldman, Robert Scoble, and Jason Calacanis.	2005 年 1 月，《財富」雜誌列出商業人士「不可忽視」的八名部落客：Peter Rojas、Xeni Jardin、Ben Trott、Mena Trott、Jonathan Schwartz、Jason Goldman、Robert Scoble 和 Jason Calacanis。
Israel was among the first national governments to set up an official blog.	以色列是設立政府官方部落格的前幾個國家之一。
Under David Saranga, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs became active in adopting Web 2.0 initiatives, including an official video blog and a political blog.	以色列外交部在 David Saranga 的帶領之下積極採用 Web 2.0 技術開創新局，包括設立官方影音部落格和政治部落格。
The Foreign Ministry also held a microblogging press conference via Twitter about its war with Hamas, with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference.	外交部也透過推特針對與哈馬斯組織之間的戰爭舉行微型部落格記者會，由 Saranga 使用簡短的文字訊息在全球直播的記者會中回答大眾媒體提問。
The questions and answers were later posted on IsraelPolitik, the country's official political blog.	問答內容後來都張貼在國家的官方政治部落格《IsraelPolitik》上面。
The impact of blogging upon the mainstream media has also been acknowledged by governments.	部落格對於主流媒體的影響，也已經得到政府認可。
In 2009, the presence of the American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy, resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area.	2009 年，美國有多家報業公司申請破產，新聞產業頓時一片愁雲慘霧，結果導致在同一發行區域相互競爭的報紙數量減少。
Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government.	坊間開始有人議論著報業是否能成為聯邦政府推出振興方案的受惠者。
U.S. President Barack Obama acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying "if the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context, then what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding”.	美國總統歐巴馬承認部落格的社會影響力越來越大，他說：「如果新聞全都奉部落格為圭臬、所有意見陳述都缺乏嚴謹的事實查證、斷章取義的行為四處可見，那麼人們到最後就只會相互叫囂謾罵，難以充分理解彼此的想法。」
Between 2009 and 2012, an Orwell Prize for blogging was awarded.	在 2009 年至 2012 年間，曾頒發過專屬於部落格的奧威爾獎。
Many bloggers, particularly those engaged in participatory journalism, are amateur journalists, and thus they differentiate themselves from the professional reporters and editors who work in mainstream media organizations.	有許多部落客 (尤其是身為參與式新聞一份子的部落客) 是業餘的新聞工作者，也因此他們會將自己和在主流媒體組織工作的專業記者及編輯區分開來。
Other bloggers are media professionals who are publishing online, rather than via a TV station or newspaper, either as an add-on to a traditional media presence (e.g., hosting a radio show or writing a column in a paper newspaper), or as their sole journalistic output.	其他部落客則是媒體從業人員，會在線上而非電視台或報紙上發表個人想法。他們有人會把部落格當成傳統媒體 (如主持廣播節目或在報紙上寫專欄) 的附加空間，有人會當成唯一的新聞發聲管道。
Some institutions and organizations see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" of media "gatekeepers" and pushing their messages directly to the public.	有些機構和組織會把部落格視為「繞過媒體守門人審查」的方法，能夠將它們的訊息直接傳遞給普羅大眾。
Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs—well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list.	同時，有許多主流媒體的新聞記者也在寫自己的部落格—根據 CyberJournalist.net 網站的新聞部落格清單 (J-blog list) 顯示，數量已經遠遠超過 300 個。
The first known use of a blog on a news site was in August 1998, when Jonathan Dube of The Charlotte Observer published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.	目前已知第一個出現在新聞網站上的部落格創建於 1998 年 8 月，當時《夏洛特觀察報》(The Charlotte Observer) 的 Jonathan Dube 創建了記錄邦妮颶風動態的部落格。
Some bloggers have moved over to other media.	有些部落客已經遷移到其他媒體平台。
The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: Duncan Black (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit), Markos Moulitsas Zúniga (Daily Kos), Alex Steffen (Worldchanging), Ana Marie Cox (Wonkette), Nate Silver (FiveThirtyEight.com), and Ezra Klein (Ezra Klein blog in The American Prospect, now in the Washington Post).	下列部落客 (及其他人) 有在廣播電台和電視台上出現：Duncan Black (他的筆名 Atrios 廣為人知)、Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit)、Markos Moulitsas Zúniga (Daily Kos)、Alex Steffen (Worldchanging)、Ana Marie Cox (Wonkette)、Nate Silver (FiveThirtyEight.com)，以及 Ezra Klein (原為《美國展望》(The American Prospect) 雜誌的 Ezra Klein 部落格，現已移至《華盛頓郵報》(Washington Post))。
In counterpoint, Hugh Hewitt exemplifies a mass media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger.	Hugh Hewitt 則反其道而行，成為大眾媒體從業人員轉換方向的典範。他藉由自已具有影響力的部落客身分來增加「舊媒體」的觸及人數。
Similarly, it was Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online blog articles that captured Surgeon General of the United States Richard Carmona's attention and earned his kudos for the associated broadcasts by talk show host Lisa Tolliver and Westchester Emergency Volunteer Reserves-Medical Reserve Corps Director Marianne Partridge.	同樣，當年美國醫務總監 Richard Carmona 當年就是注意到了《廣播及線上緊急整備與安全提示》(Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online) 部落格上的文章，並大力讚揚由談話節目主持人 Lisa Tolliver 和西徹斯特郡緊急醫療志願後備軍醫療後備隊隊長 Marianne Partridge 共同主持的相關廣播節目。
Blogs have also had an influence on minority languages, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in Gaelic languages.	部落格也影響了少數語言，讓散居各地的母語人士和學習者得以齊聚一堂，其中蓋爾語的相關部落格尤具成效。
Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.	少數語言的發表內容 (往往在經濟層面無以為繼) 可以透過平價的部落格寫作方式來找到閱聽眾。
There are examples of bloggers who have published books based on their blogs, e.g., Salam Pax, Ellen Simonetti, Jessica Cutler, ScrappleFace.	以下列舉幾位將自己的部落格文章集結出版的部落客：Salam Pax, Ellen Simonetti、Jessica Cutler、ScrappleFace。

A prize for the best blog-based book was initiated in 2005, the Lulu Blooker Prize.	專門表揚最佳部落格書的「Lulu 部落格書獎」於 2005 年開始頒發。
However, success has been elusive offline, with many of these books not selling as well as their blogs.	然而，線上的成功卻不保證線下也能獲得佳績，這類書籍的銷售熱度有許多都比不上部落格本身的人氣。
The book based on Julie Powell's blog "The Julie/Julia Project" was made into the film Julie & Julia, apparently the first to do so.	將 Julie Powell 的「The Julie/Julia Project」部落格內容集結出版的書籍後來翻拍成電影《美味關係》(Julie & Julia)，首開業界先例。
Consumer-generated advertising is a relatively new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers.	消費者創作廣告行銷是較為新穎且具有爭議的趨勢發展，建立了公司企業與消費者之間的嶄新行銷傳播模式。
Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts.	在各式各樣的部落格廣告行銷中，最具爭議的莫過於業配文。
These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords.	這些會是以意見回饋、評論、意見表述、影片等形式發表的部落格內容或貼文，而且通常內含使用了一組或多組關鍵詞的業配網站連結。
Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites.	部落格導致了某種程度的去中間化並瓦解了傳統的廣告行銷模式，讓公司能夠略過廣告代理商 (這在之前是接觸顧客的唯一窗口)，直接透過社群媒體網站與顧客聯繫。
On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, to take advantage of this new development as well.	另一方面，專營部落格廣告行銷的新創公司也紛紛設立，搭上新一波趨勢發展的順風車。
However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development.	然而，有許多人並不看好這樣的趨勢發展。
Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.	有些人相信部落格上的各種商業行為將會毀壞部落格圈的可信度。
Blogging can result in a range of legal liabilities and other unforeseen consequences.	書寫部落格可能會面臨到一連串的法律責任以及其他意料之外的後果。
Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers concerning issues of defamation or liability.	法庭上已經出現好幾起部落客涉嫌誹謗或得面臨法律責任的案件。
U.S. payouts related to blogging totaled $17.4 million by 2009; in some cases these have been covered by umbrella insurance.	2009 年，美國境內與部落格相關的罰鍰總額為一千七百四十萬美元，其中有一部分是傘護式責任保險的理賠金。
The courts have returned with mixed verdicts.	每個法庭的判決結果都不太一樣。
Internet Service Providers (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. Communications Decency Act and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC).	一般而言，網際網路服務供應商 (ISP) 對於來自第三方的資訊概不擔負法律責 (參照《美國通訊端正法》(U.S. Communications Decency Act) 和《歐盟電子商務指令》(EU Directive 2000/31/EC)) 。
In Doe v. Cahill, the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration.	在 Doe v. Cahill 訴訟案的審理過程中，德拉瓦州立最高法院堅持要在符合嚴格標準的情形下查出匿名部落客的真實身分，並且罕見地撤銷誹謗告訴 (此舉無美國誹謗罪相關法律根據) 而非駁回初審法院重新審理。
In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival.	案情接著急轉直下，Cahill 團隊順利得知 John Doe 的真實身分，正是他們之前所懷疑的那個人：當地城鎮的鎮長，為 Cahill 議員的政敵。
The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial.	Cahill 團隊隨後修正了原先的告訴，那位鎮長則以和解避免了後續審判。
In January 2007, two prominent Malaysian political bloggers, Jeff Ooi and Ahirudin Attan, were sued by a pro-government newspaper, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan, Hishamuddin bin Aun and Brenden John a/l John Pereira over an alleged defamation.	2007 年 1 月，兩位知名的馬來西亞政論部落客，Jeff Ooi 和 Ahirudin Attan，因涉嫌誹謗而遭到親政府報紙媒體 (《馬來西亞新海峽時報》(The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia)) 的 Berhad、Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan、Hishamuddin bin Aun 和 Brenden John a/l John Pereira 等人提告。
The plaintiff was supported by the Malaysian government.	馬來西亞政府在當時支持原告。
Following the suit, the Malaysian government proposed to "register" all bloggers in Malaysia in order to better control parties against their interest.	在訴訟過後，馬來西亞政府提議要國內所有部落客「註冊登記」，以便嚴加管控會影響到政府利益的派系人馬。
This is the first such legal case against bloggers in the country.	這是該國首例提告部落客的法律訴訟。
In the United States, blogger Aaron Wall was sued by Traffic Power for defamation and publication of trade secrets in 2005.	2005 年，部落客 Aaron Wall 在美國遭到 Traffic Power 公司提告誹謗以及公開營業秘密。
According to Wired magazine, Traffic Power had been "banned from Google for allegedly rigging search engine results." Wall and other "white hat" search engine optimization consultants had exposed Traffic Power in what they claim was an effort to protect the public.	據《連線》(Wired) 雜誌報導，Traffic Power 曾因為「涉嫌操縱搜尋引擎的搜尋結果而遭 Google 下達禁令」。Wall 和其他「白帽」搜尋引擎最佳化諮詢顧問則以保護普羅大眾之名，揭發了 Traffic Power 的惡行惡狀。
The case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Traffic Power failed to appeal within the allowed time.	這起訴訟案因為缺少屬人管轄權而遭到撤銷，Traffic Power 也並未在允許的時限內提起上訴。
The word "pineapple" in English was first recorded to describe the reproductive organs of conifer trees (now termed pine cones).	據文獻記載，英文中的「鳳梨」(pineapple) 一開始是用來形容針葉樹的果實 (如今均改以「松果」(pine cones) 稱之)。
When European explorers encountered this tropical fruit in the Americas, they called them "pineapples" (first referenced in 1664, for resemblance to pine cones).	當年，來自歐洲的探險者在美洲遇見了這種熱帶水果，就稱其為「pineapple」(首見於 1664 年的文獻，因為覺得這水果形似松果)。
In the scientific binomial Ananas comosus, ananas, the original name of the fruit, comes from the Tupi word nanas, meaning "excellent fruit", as recorded by André Thevet in 1555, and comosus, "tufted", refers to the stem of the fruit.	這種水果的原始學名為 Ananas (鳳梨屬) 的 Ananas comosus，源自於巴西圖皮族語的「nanas」，即「絕佳水果」之意。該族語名稱由 André Thevet 於 1555 年記錄在相關文獻中。學名中的「comosus」 (「叢生」之意) 則是用來指稱這種水果的莖部。
Other members of the genus Ananas are often called pine, as well, in other languages.	鳳梨屬的其他成員在其他語言中也通常會以「松」(pine) 為名。
In the wild, pineapples are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds.	野生的鳳梨主要都是透過蜂鳥幫忙授粉。
Certain wild pineapples are foraged and pollinated at night by bats.	有某些品種的野生鳳梨則在夜間供蝙蝠覓食並協助授粉。
Under cultivation, because seed development diminishes fruit quality, pollination is performed by hand, and seeds are retained only for breeding.	在種植過程中，因為種子的發育會損害水果品質，所以一律採取人工授粉，種子僅保留為育種用途。
Specifically in Hawaii, where pineapples were cultivated and canned industrially throughout the 20th century, importation of hummingbirds was prohibited.	夏威夷從二十世紀以來已經種植鳳梨並建立鳳梨罐頭工業達百年之久，這裡明文規定禁止讓蜂鳥入境。
The plant is indigenous to South America and is said to originate from the area between southern Brazil and Paraguay; however, little is known about the origin of the domesticated pineapple (Pickersgill, 1976).	鳳梨是在南美洲土生土長的水果，據說其發源地為介於巴西南部和巴拉圭之間的區域。然而，人工種植鳳梨的起源卻鮮為人知 (Pickersgill, 1976)。
MS Bertoni (1919) considered the Paraná–Paraguay River drainages to be the place of origin of A. comosus.	MS Bertoni (1919) 認為巴拉那—巴拉圭河流域為鳳梨的起源地。
The natives of southern Brazil and Paraguay spread the pineapple throughout South America, and it eventually reached the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico, where it was cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs.	巴西和巴拉圭的原住民將鳳梨傳播到南美洲各地，最終抵達了加勒比海地區、中美洲和墨西哥，讓馬雅人和阿茲特克人種植養育。
Columbus encountered the pineapple in 1493 on the leeward island of Guadeloupe.	哥倫布於 1493 年在瓜地洛普的背風群島遇見了鳳梨。
He called it piña de Indes, meaning "pine of the Indians", and brought it back with him to Spain, thus making the pineapple the first bromeliad to be introduced by humans outside of the New World.	他稱之為「piña de Indes」(即「印地安松果」之意)，並將它帶回去西班牙，鳳梨就此成為在新大陸之外的人們首次認識到的鳳梨科植物。
The Spanish introduced it into the Philippines, Hawaii (introduced in the 18th century, first commercial plantation 1886), Zimbabwe, and Guam.	西班牙人隨後將鳳梨引進菲律賓、夏威夷 (於十八世紀引進，並於 1886 年首度進行商業種植)、辛巴威和關島。

The first pineapple to be successfully cultivated in Europe, is said to have been grown by Pieter de la Court at Meerburg in 1658.	據說在歐洲成功種出來的第一顆鳳梨是由 Pieter de la Court 於 1658 年在密爾堡 (Meerburg) 種植養育完成。
In England, the first pineapple was grown at Dorney Court, Dorney in Buckinghamshire, and a huge "pineapple stove" needed to grow the plants had been built at the Chelsea Physic Garden in 1723.	在英國，鳳梨首次栽種於白金漢郡多尼村的多尼莊園 (Dorney Court)，之後則於 1723 年在切爾西藥草園 (Chelsea Physic Garden) 建造了一座巨大的鳳梨溫室。
In France, King Louis XV was presented with a pineapple that had been grown at Versailles in 1733. Catherine the Great ate pineapples grown on her own estates before her death in 1796.	在法國，有人於 1733 年進貢了在凡爾賽地區種植的鳳梨給法國國王路易十五。俄國女皇凱薩琳二世則在 1796 年逝世之前吃過種植在自家皇宮內的鳳梨。
Because of the expense of direct import and the enormous cost in equipment and labour required to grow them in a temperate climate, using hothouses called "pineries", pineapples soon became a symbol of wealth.	因為直接進口鳳梨的費用高昂，再加上於溫帶氣候種植鳳梨需要耗資鉅額購買設備、聘請勞工與建造名為「鳳梨園」的溫室設施，鳳梨很快就成為了財富象徵。
They were initially used mainly for display at dinner parties, rather than being eaten, and were used again and again until they began to rot.	鳳梨一開始主要是用來當作晚宴聚會上的展示品，並非拿來食用，而且會重複使用到鳳梨開始腐爛為止。
By the second half of the 18th century, the production of the fruit on British estates had become the subject of great rivalry between wealthy aristocrats.	到了十八世紀下半葉，在英國莊園內種植鳳梨成為了豪紳貴族之間相互較勁的主要項目。
John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore built a hothouse on his estate surmounted by a huge stone cupola 14 metres tall in the shape of the fruit; it is known as the Dunmore Pineapple.	John Murray，世襲第四代鄧莫爾伯爵，曾在自家莊園建造了一座溫室，並在溫室上方蓋了一座高達 14 公尺的巨大石造圓頂，且以鳳梨為型，故有「鄧莫爾鳳梨」之稱。
John Kidwell is credited with the introduction of the pineapple industry to Hawaii; large-scale pineapple cultivation by US companies began in the early 1900s.	John Kidwell 為讓夏威夷開始出現鳳梨產業的主要人物。由美國公司主導的大規模鳳梨栽種則於 1900 年代早期開始進行。
Among the most famous and influential pineapple industrialists was James Dole, who moved to Hawaii in 1899 and started a pineapple plantation in 1900.	James Dole 為當時最有名氣且最具影響力的鳳梨大亨之一，他於 1899 年遷居夏威夷，並於 1900 年開始栽種鳳梨。

Del Monte took cultivar '73–114', dubbed 'MD-2', to its plantations in Costa Rica, found it to be well-suited to growing there, and launched it publicly in 1996 as 'Gold Extra Sweet', while Del Monte also began marketing '73–50', dubbed 'CO-2', as 'Del Monte Gold'.	德爾蒙公司將別稱「MD-2」的「73–114」號鳳梨品種栽種於哥斯大黎加，發現這款品種相當適合當地的生長環境，並於 1996 年以「極甜金鳳梨」為名公開販售。德爾蒙公司同時也開始以「德爾蒙金鳳梨」為名行銷另一款別稱「CO-2」的「73-50」號鳳梨品種。
Dole ceased its cannery operations in Honolulu in 1991, and in 2008, Del Monte terminated its pineapple-growing operations in Hawaii.	都樂公司設立於檀香山的罐頭工廠於 1991 年停止運作，德爾蒙公司則於 2008 年終止在夏威夷的鳳梨栽種事業。
In 2009, the Maui Pineapple Company reduced its operations to supply pineapples only locally on Maui, and by 2013, only the Dole Plantation on Oahu grew pineapples in a volume of about 0.1 percent of the world's production.	2009 年，茂宜鳳梨公司將營運規模縮減為專營茂宜本島的鳳梨供銷業務。到了 2013 年，只剩下都樂公司的鳳梨園還在歐胡島上營運，產量約莫為全球總產量的千分之一。
The 'Red Spanish' cultivar of pineapples were also traditionally widely cultivated in the Philippines for the textile industry from at least the 17th century.	名為「紅色西班牙」的鳳梨品種最晚從十七世紀開始於菲律賓境內廣泛栽種，供紡織工業使用。
They were originally brought to the islands from Latin America during the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines.	這款鳳梨最先是在西班牙殖民期間從拉丁美洲引進菲律賓。
Smooth Cayenne' was later introduced in the early 1900s by the Bureau of Agriculture during the American colonial period.	之後在 1900 年代早期的美國殖民期間，農業部引進了「開英種」鳳梨。
Dole and Del Monte also established plantations in the island of Mindanao in the 1920s; in the provinces of Cotabato and Bukidnon, respectively.	都樂公司和德爾蒙公司也於 1920 年代在民答那峨島上建立了鳳梨園，分別位於哥打巴托省 (Cotabato) 和布基農省 (Bukidnon)。
The Philippines remain one of the top exporters of pineapples in the world.	菲律賓至今仍然是全球數一數二的鳳梨出口國。
The Del Monte plantations are now locally managed, after Del Monte Pacific Ltd., a Filipino company, completed the purchase of Del Monte Foods in 2014.	德爾蒙公司的鳳梨園現由菲律賓本地的德爾蒙太平洋股份有限公司 (Del Monte Pacific Ltd.) 負責管理。該公司於 2014 年完成併購德爾蒙食品公司。
The 'Red Spanish' cultivar of pineapples were once extensively cultivated in the Philippines.	「紅色西班牙」鳳梨曾經一度遍植於菲律賓境內各地。
The long leaves of the cultivar were the source of traditional piña fibers, an adaptation of the native weaving traditions with fibers extracted from abacá.	該品種的長條鳳梨葉為傳統鳳梨纖維織料的來源，用來取代傳統原住民使用的馬尼拉麻蕉纖維織料。
These were woven into lustrous lace-like nipis fabrics usually decorated with intricate floral embroidery known as calado and sombrado.	這些織料會編織成有著蕾絲般光澤的輕薄布料，通常會繡上名為「卡拉朵」(calado) 和「索布拉朵」(sombrados) 的精細花朵圖樣。
The fabric was a luxury export from the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period and gained favor among European aristocracy in the 18th and 19th centuries.	在西班牙殖民期間。這種布料為自菲律賓出口的奢侈品，並於 18 和 19 世紀廣受歐洲貴族喜愛。
Domestically, they were used to make the traditional barong Tagalog, baro't saya, and traje de mestiza clothing of the Filipino upper class, as well as women's kerchiefs (pañuelo).	在菲律賓境內，這些布料會用來為菲律賓的上流階級製作巴隆他加祿 (Barong Tagalog)、巴羅特沙耶 (baro't saya) 和特拉耶德梅蒂莎 (traje de mestiza) 等傳統服飾，以及女性的頭巾 (pañuelo)。
They were favored for their light and breezy quality, which was ideal in the hot tropical climate of the islands.	其輕盈且透氣的質地十分適合島上的熱帶氣候，受到眾人喜愛。]
The industry was destroyed in the Second World War and is only starting to be revived.	該紡織產業在二戰期間遭毀，只能努力恢復往日榮景。
In 2017, world production of pineapples was 27.4 million tons, led by Costa Rica, the Philippines, Brazil, and Thailand as the largest producers.	2017 年，全球的鳳梨總產量達二千七百四十萬噸，主要出口國為哥斯大黎加、菲律賓、巴西和泰國。
In commercial farming, flowering can be induced artificially, and the early harvesting of the main fruit can encourage the development of a second crop of smaller fruits.	在商業農作方面，目前可以透過人工方式誘發鳳梨開花。主要水果作物若可提前採收，就能夠鼓勵栽種較小的水果當作二期作物。
Once removed during cleaning, the top of the pineapple can be planted in soil and a new plant will grow.	鳳梨頭在清洗過程中切除後，即可種到土裡長出新作物。
Three-quarters of the pineapples sold in Europe are grown in Costa Rica, where pineapple production is highly industrialised.	在歐洲銷售的鳳梨有四分之三栽種於哥斯大黎加，當地的鳳梨產業已高度工業化。
Growers typically use 20 kg (44 lb) of pesticides per hectare in each growing cycle, a process that may affect soil quality and biodiversity.	一般而言，在每一期的鳳梨耕作期間，每一公頃的田地會用到 20 公斤 (44 磅) 的農藥，這過程可能會影響到土壤品質和生態多樣性。
The pesticides—organophosphates, organochlorines, and hormone disruptors—have the potential to affect workers' health and can contaminate local drinking water supplies.	這些農藥 (內含有機磷和荷爾蒙干擾素) 有可能會影響耕作人員的身體健康，且會汙染當地的飲用水源。
Many of these chemicals have potential to be carcinogens, and may be related to birth defects.	其中還有許多可能會致癌以及造成先天缺陷的化學物質。
Because of commercial pressures, many pineapple workers in Costa Rica—60% of whom are Nicaraguan—are paid low wages.	因為公司方有經營壓力，許多位於哥斯大黎加的耕作人員 (其中有六成是尼加拉瓜人) 的薪資都只是杯水車薪。
European supermarkets' price-reduction policies have lowered growers' incomes.	歐洲超市的降價政策讓耕作者的收入隨之減少。
One major pineapple producer contests these claims.	其中有個主要的鳳梨生產國質疑這些主帳。
Pineapple fruits and peels contain diverse phytochemicals, among which are polyphenols, including gallic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and arbutin.	鳳梨的果肉和果皮均含有豐富多樣的植化素，其中有些屬於多酚類，包括沒食子酸、丁香酸、香蘭素、阿魏酸、芥子酸、香豆酸、綠原酸、表兒茶素和熊果素。
Present in all parts of the pineapple plant, bromelain is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes.	鳳梨全株均含有鳳梨酵素，為蛋白水解酵素的混合物。
Bromelain is under preliminary research for a variety of clinical disorders, but to date has not been adequately defined for its effects in the human body.	現在有各式各樣的臨床症狀以鳳梨酵素為初步研究項目，但是到目前為止仍沒有充分證據確定其對於人體的影響。
Bromelain may be unsafe for some users, such as in pregnancy, allergies, or anticoagulation therapy.	鳳梨酵素可能會對孕婦、過敏症患者或是有在服用抗凝血劑的使用者造成危險。
If having sufficient bromelain content, raw pineapple juice may be useful as a meat marinade and tenderizer.	如果生鳳梨汁裡含有充足的鳳梨酵素，不妨拿來醃肉，可以讓肉質更加軟嫩。
Although pineapple enzymes can interfere with the preparation of some foods or manufactured products, such as gelatin-based desserts or gel capsules, their proteolytic activity responsible for such properties may be degraded during cooking and canning.	儘管如此，鳳梨酵素還是會在調理某些食物或製作凝凍類甜點或凝膠膠囊等加工製品時造成干擾，因為其蛋白分解活性會在烹煮和裝罐的過程中導致酵素變質。
The quantity of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, but specific extraction can yield sufficient quantities for domestic and industrial processing.	在一般用量的鳳梨果肉中大概不會有太多鳳梨酵素，不過在經過特別萃取後，仍可取得足以進行家庭料理和加工處理的酵素量。
Pineapples are subject to a variety of diseases, the most serious of which is wilt disease vectored by mealybugs typically found on the surface of pineapples, but possibly in the closed blossom cups.	鳳梨本身容易染上多種疾病，其中最嚴重的是經粉介殼蟲傳染的萎凋病。粉介殼蟲一般常見於鳳梨表皮，但也有可能躲藏在緊閉的花苞中。
Other diseases include citrus pink disease, bacterial heart rot, anthracnose, fungal heart rot, root rot, black rot, butt rot, fruitlet core rot, and yellow spot virus.	其他疾病則包括赤衣病、細菌性心腐病、炭疽病、真菌性心腐病、根腐病、黑腐病、基腐病、小果腐敗病和黃斑病毒等。
Pineapple pink disease (not citrus pink disease) is characterized by the fruit developing a brownish to black discoloration when heated during the canning process.	鳳梨赤衣病 (非柑橘赤衣病) 的特徵為果肉在裝罐過程中會因為高溫加熱而出現由褐轉黑的變色現象。
The causal agents of pink disease are the bacteria Acetobacter aceti, Gluconobacter oxydans, Pantoea citrea.	赤衣病的病原為醋酸菌、氧化葡萄糖酸桿菌、檸檬泛菌
and Tatumella ptyseos.	以及痰塔特姆式菌。
Some pests that commonly affect pineapple plants are scales, thrips, mites, mealybugs, ants, and symphylids.	鳳梨植株常見的害蟲為介殼蟲、薊馬、螨蟲、粉介殼蟲、螞蟻和結足蟲。
Heart-rot is the most serious disease affecting pineapple plants.	心腐病為對鳳梨植株影響最重大的疾病。
The disease is caused by Phytophthora cinnamoni and P. parasitica, fungi that often affect pineapples grown in wet conditions.	該疾病是由樟疫黴和疫病菌 (P. parasitica) 所導致，通常會在潮濕天候中影響鳳梨生長。
Since it is difficult to treat, it is advisable to guard against infection by planting resistant cultivars where these are available; all suckers that are required for propagation should be dipped in a fungicide, since the fungus enters through the wounds.	因為該疾病難以治療，建議在條件允許下透過栽種具有抵抗力的品種來防止染疫，且因為真菌會透過傷口入侵，所以繁殖所需的吸芽均需浸泡在殺菌劑中。
Some buyers prefer green fruit, others ripened or off-green.	有些買家偏愛未熟的青綠水果，有些則偏愛熟透或半熟的水果。
A plant growth regulator, Ethephon, is typically sprayed onto the fruit one week before harvest, developing ethylene, which turns the fruit golden yellow.	益收生長素 (Ethephon) 為植物生長調節劑，一般會在採收前一週拿來噴灑在水果上，產生會讓水果金黃熟透的乙烯。
After cleaning and slicing, a pineapple is typically canned in sugar syrup with added preservative.	鳳梨在清洗和切片過後，一般會和糖漿一同裝罐，並加入防腐劑。
A pineapple never becomes any riper than it was when harvested.	鳳梨在採收之後就不會再繼續熟成。
The fruit itself is quite perishable and if it is stored at room temperature, it should be used within two days; however, if it is refrigerated, the time span extends to 5–7 days.	若儲藏在室溫中，其果肉本身相當容易腐壞，應於兩天內食用完畢。不過，若是放在冰箱冷藏，則儲藏時間可以延長至 5 到 7 天。
Mimi Sheller writes: "The pineapple entered European iconography as a symbol of welcome and hospitality, and also eventually found its way into botanical gardens such as the Chelsea Physic Garden, where it was grown in heated pits." The sweet fruit had a "mysterious aura" in the Age of Sail because except for a "small elite with access to glass hothouses", tropical fruits could only be tasted where they were cultivated.	Mimi Sheller 寫道：「鳳梨剛開始在歐洲的圖像學裡為熱情歡迎和殷勤好客的象徵，後來則踏進如切爾西藥草園那般的庭園之中，在溫室中成長茁壯。」這款滋味甜美的水果大航海時代曾有著「神秘香氣」，因為除了「少數得以進入玻璃溫室的貴族菁英」之外，就只能在原先種植的地方才能品嚐到這類熱帶水果。
Christopher Cumo writes that "The Spanish who followed Columbus delighted in eating pineapple and in writing about it for a European public eager to learn of the flora and fauna of the Americas ...	Christopher Cumo 寫道：「跟隨著哥倫布的西班牙人十分喜歡吃鳳梨，也一邊寫著關於鳳梨的文章，滿足歐洲的普羅大眾對於美洲當地動植物的求知欲望…
The pineapple was first a luxury because transit from the tropics to Europe was expensive in the age of sail.	因為在大航海時代，從熱帶地區運送貨物到歐洲的費用高昂，所以鳳梨一開始是種奢侈品。
In this respect, pineapple was much like sugar, a commodity of privilege before it became an item of the masses." Cumo writes that "pineapple was the fruit of colonialism" because the Portuguese, French, Dutch, and British all sought to establish pineapple plantations in the tropics of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean.	從這方面來看，鳳梨就像是糖一般，在成為大眾日常用品之前曾是特權階級才能享有的商品。」Cumo 接著寫道：「鳳梨是殖民主義之果」，因為葡萄牙、法國、荷蘭和英國等殖民政權都相繼設法在位處熱帶的南美洲、中美洲及加勒比海地區建造鳳梨園。
In architecture, pineapple figures are a decorative element symbolizing hospitality.	在建築學中，鳳梨圖像為象徵熱情好客的裝飾元素。
Usually in plaster or carved wood, pineapples images occur in finials, pendants,"broken" pediments, and door knockers.	鳳梨圖像通常會以石膏或木雕等形式當做尖頂裝飾、吊飾、鑲嵌楣飾和門環裝飾。
Pineapples have long been associated with the Hawaiian Islands, to the extent that the pineapple is sometimes used as a symbol of Hawaii, despite the decline of the pineapple industry in that state.	鳳梨長年來都會和夏威夷群島聯想在一起，儘管當地的鳳梨產業每況愈下，鳳梨有時候還是會被用來當成夏威夷的象徵。
Foods with pineapple in them are sometimes known as "Hawaiian" for this reason alone.	就是因為如此，加入鳳梨的料理有時候也會被稱為「夏威夷」料理。
A roller coaster is a type of amusement ride that employs a form of elevated railroad track designed with tight turns, steep slopes, and sometimes inversions.	雲霄飛車是一種使用高架軌道的遊樂設施，其軌道會有急彎和陡坡等設計，有時候還會出現倒置翻轉。
People ride along the track in open cars, and the rides are often found in amusement parks and theme parks around the world.	遊客乘坐在軌道上的開放式車廂中，世界各地的遊樂園和主題樂園通常都會有這項遊樂設施。
LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained one of the first known patents for a roller coaster design in 1885, related to the Switchback Railway that opened a year earlier at Coney Island.	LaMarcus Adna Thompson 於 1885 年獲得其中一項目前已知的首批雲霄飛車設計專利，與前一年在康尼島上開放遊玩的「折返鐵道」(Switchback Railway) 雲霄飛車有關。
The track in a coaster design does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate.	雲霄飛車的軌道設計並非一定是個完整的迴圈，好比飛梭式雲霄飛車所展示的軌道樣貌。
Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained.	大多數的雲霄飛車都有多節車廂，遊客可坐在裡面並受到安全裝置保護。
Two or more cars hooked together are called a train.	兩節以上接連扣在一起的車廂會稱為「列車」。
Some roller coasters, notably Wild Mouse roller coasters, run with single cars.	有些雲霄飛車是以單節車廂運轉，如著名的「野鼠」(Wild Mouse) 雲霄飛車。
The oldest roller coasters are believed to have originated from the so-called "Russian Mountains", specially constructed hills of ice located in the area that is now Saint Petersburg, Russia.	雲霄飛車的始祖據信是起源自名為「俄羅斯山」的滑雪設施，特別建造在今日俄國聖彼得堡地區的冰雪山丘上。
Built in the 17th century, the slides were built to a height of between 21 and 24 m (70 and 80 feet), had a 50-degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports.	該設施建造於十七世紀，高度介於 21 公尺 (約 70 英尺) 至 24 公尺 (約 80英尺) 之間，滑坡的坡度達 50 度，以木造結構穩固支撐。
Later, in 1784, Catherine the Great is said to have constructed a sledding hill in the gardens of her palace at Oranienbaum in St. Petersburg.	據說後來在 1784 年，凱薩琳大帝在位於聖彼得堡的奧拉寧鮑姆宮中庭園建造了一座滑雪丘。
The name Russian Mountains to designate a roller coaster is preserved in many languages (e.g. the Spanish montaña rusa), but the Russian term for roller coasters is американские горки ("amerikanskiye gorki"), which translates to "American mountains."	在許多語言當中，「俄羅斯山」這個名稱都是用來指稱雲霄飛車 (例如西班牙文的「montaña rusa」)，但是俄文中的雲霄飛車卻是「американские горки (『amerikanskiye gorki』)」，直譯為「美國山」之意。
The first modern roller coaster, the Promenades Aeriennes, opened in Parc Beaujon in Paris on July 8, 1817.	首座現代雲霄飛車為「空中漫遊」(Promenades Aeriennes)，於 1817 年 7 月 8 日在巴黎的博容樂園 (Parc Beaujon) 正式營運。
It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds.	該雲霄飛車的特色為輪子牢牢鎖在軌道上的車廂、設有防止車廂偏離的導軌，以及更快的速度。
It spawned half a dozen imitators, but their popularity soon declined.	後來接連出現了六座仿造的雲霄飛車，但是人氣很快就一落千丈。
However, during the Belle Epoque they returned to fashion.	然而到了「美好年代」 (Belle Epoque) 時期，這些雲霄飛車再度讓大眾趨之若鶩。
In 1887 French entrepreneur Joseph Oller, co-founder of the Moulin Rouge music hall, constructed the Montagnes Russes de Belleville, "Russian Mountains of Belleville" with 656 feet (200 m) of track laid out in a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.	1887 年，法國企業家 Joseph Oller (即紅磨坊 (Moulin Rouge) 音樂廳的共同創辦人) 打造出「美麗城俄羅斯山」(Montagnes Russes de Belleville) 雲霄飛車。其長達 656 英尺 (200 公尺) 的軌道鋪設成雙重 8 字型迴圈，後來再擴建為四重 8 字型迴圈。
In 1827, a mining company in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania constructed the Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway, a downhill gravity railroad used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania – now known as Jim Thorpe.	1827 年。有一間位於賓州薩米特山的礦業公司建造了莫赫瓊克折返鐵道 (Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway)，為利用重力將煤礦運到山下的賓州莫赫瓊克地區 (今吉姆索普區) 的鐵道。
By the 1850s, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers.	到了 1850 年代，這條「重力鐵道」(後來的慣稱) 開始賣票給想要追求刺激的遊客。
Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.	鐵道公司會在載客量少的那幾天使用類似的軌道設施來提供娛樂。
Using this idea as a basis, LaMarcus Adna Thompson began work on a gravity Switchback Railway that opened at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, in 1884. Passengers climbed to the top of a platform and rode a bench-like car down the 600-foot (183 m) track up to the top of another tower where the vehicle was switched to a return track and the passengers took the return trip.	LaMarcus Adna Thompson 以此想法為基礎開始設計由重力導引的「折返鐵道」雲霄飛車，並於 1884 年在紐約布魯克林區的康尼島正式營運。遊客要先爬到頂端平台，然後坐上像長椅一般的的車廂，直接向下俯衝長達 600 英尺 (183 公尺) 的軌道，來到另一座高塔的頂端。車廂會在這裡切換到返程軌道上，讓遊客沿著原路歸返。
This track design was soon replaced with an oval complete circuit.	這項軌道設計很快就讓完整的橢圓形迴圈所取代。
In 1885, Phillip Hinkle introduced the first full-circuit coaster with a lift hill, the Gravity Pleasure Road, which became the most popular attraction at Coney Island.	1885 年，Phillip Hinkle 打造出第一座設有爬升坡及完整迴圈的雲霄飛車 (即「重力樂遨遊」(Gravity Pleasure Road)，隨後成為康尼島上最受歡迎的樂園景點。
Not to be outdone, in 1886 Thompson patented his design of roller coaster that included dark tunnels with painted scenery.	Thompson 不甘示弱，於 1886 年為自己包含了漆黑隧道和景觀圖畫的雲霄飛車設計申請了專利。
"Scenic Railways" were soon found in amusement parks across the county.	沒過多久，「景觀鐵道」如雨後春筍般出現在全國各地的遊樂園中。
By 1919, the first underfriction roller coaster had been developed by John Miller.	到了 1919 年，John Miller 研發出第一座低摩擦雲霄飛車。
Soon, roller coasters spread to amusement parks all around the world.	不久，雲霄飛車便出現在全球各地的遊樂園中。
Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, Cyclone, was opened at Coney Island in 1927.	於 1927 年在康尼島上正式營運的「旋風」(Cyclone) 雲霄飛車，可說是史上最知名的雲霄飛車。
The Great Depression marked the end of the golden age of roller coasters, and theme parks, in general, went into decline.	經濟大蕭條讓雲霄飛車的黃金年代告終，主題樂園也普遍開始走下坡。
This lasted until 1972 when the instant success of The Racer at Kings Island began a roller coaster renaissance which has continued to this day.	直到 1972 年，「國王島賽車手」(The Racer at Kings Island) 一夕爆紅，這才讓雲霄飛車重返榮耀並延續至今。
In 1959, Disneyland introduced a design breakthrough with Matterhorn Bobsleds, the first roller coaster to use a tubular steel track.	1959 年，迪士尼樂園使用突破以往的設計概念上打造出「馬特洪雪橇歷險」 (Matterhorn Bobsleds)，這是第一座使用鋼管軌道的雲霄飛車。
Unlike wooden coaster rails, tubular steel can be bent in any direction, allowing designers to incorporate loops, corkscrews, and many other maneuvers into their designs.	不同於木造軌道，鋼軌可以往各種方向彎折，讓設計師得以在設計圖稿中納入迴圈、螺旋和其他許多巧妙變化。
Most modern roller coasters are made of steel, although wooden coasters and hybrids are still being built.	現代大部分的雲霄飛車都是以鋼鐵建成。儘管如此，現在還是有人在建造木製和鐵木混合的雲霄飛車。
There are several explanations of the name roller coaster.	「雲霄飛車」(roller coaster) 的命名緣由有好幾種說法。
It is said to have originated from an early American design where slides or ramps were fitted with rollers over which a sled would coast.	據說這名稱源自於早期的美式設計。當時會在滑坡軌道上裝設滾輪，讓橇板可以直接溜下去。
This design was abandoned in favor of fitting the wheels to the sled or other vehicles, but the name endured.	這項設計後來改成將輪子安裝到橇板或其他設施載具上，但名稱維持不變。
Another explanation is that it originated from a ride located in a roller skating rink in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1887.	另一種說法是該名稱起源自 1887 年某座位於麻州黑弗里爾一處溜冰場內的遊樂設施。
A toboggan-like sled was raised to the top of a track which consisted of hundreds of rollers.	載具看起像是平底雪橇，抬升到裝設了上百顆滾輪的軌道上方。
This Roller Toboggan then took off down gently rolling hills to the floor.	平底雪橇飛車接著會緩緩從山丘上滑落到地面。
The inventors of this ride, Stephen E. Jackman and Byron B. Floyd, claim that they were the first to use the term "roller coaster".	這項設施的發明者為 Stephen E. Jackman 和 Byron B. Floyd，據稱他們就是首先使用「roller coaster」做為名稱的人。
The term jet coaster is used for roller coasters in Japan, where such amusement park rides are very popular.	日本則稱雲霄飛車為「噴射飛車」，在當地的遊樂園中十分受歡迎。
In many languages, the name refers to "Russian mountains".	在許多語言中會以「俄羅斯山」來稱呼雲霄飛車。
Contrastingly, in Russian, they are called "American mountains".	俄文卻反倒稱呼雲霄飛車為「美國山」。
In the Scandinavian languages and German, the roller coaster is referred as "mountain-and-valley railway".	在斯堪地那維亞語系和德文中，雲霄飛車被稱作是「山嶺峻谷鐵道」。
German also knows the word "Achterbahn", stemming from "Figur-8-Bahn", like Dutch "Achtbaan", relating to the form of the number 8 ("acht" in German and also Dutch).	德文也會以「Achterbahn」指稱雲霄飛車，其字首根源自德文的「8 字形鐵道」(如同荷蘭文的「Achtbaan」)，和飛車軌道的 8 字形狀有所關聯 (「acht」在德文和荷蘭文中都有「8」的意思)。
Several height classifications have been used by parks and manufacturers in marketing their roller coasters, as well as enthusiasts within the industry.	遊樂園園方和製造商在行銷雲霄飛車時有使用好幾個高度類別，業界的雲霄飛車愛好者也會跟著使用。
One classification, the kiddie coaster, is a roller coaster specifically designed for younger riders.	其中一個類別為兒童雲霄飛車，專門設計給較為年幼的乘客遊玩。
Following World War II, parks began pushing for more of them to be built in contrast to the height and age restrictions of standard designs at the time.	在二戰過後，遊樂園紛紛開始建造更多與當時年齡及身高標準限制大相逕庭的兒童雲霄飛車。
Companies like Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) developed scaled-down versions of their larger models to accommodate the demand.	如費城雪橇飛車公司 (Philadelphia Toboggan Company，簡稱 PTC) 等業者相繼發展出等比縮小版的雲霄飛車來順應市場需求。
These typically featured lift hills smaller than 25 feet (7.6 m), and still do today.	一般而言，這類雲霄飛車的爬坡高度會低於 25 英尺 (7.6 公尺)，至今依然如此。
The rise of kiddie coasters soon led to the development of "junior" models that had lift hills up to 45 feet (14 m).	兒童雲霄飛車興起之後沒多久，將爬坡高度提高到 45 英尺 (14 公尺) 的「青少年」版於焉誕生。
A notable example of a junior coaster is the Sea Dragon – the oldest operating roller coaster from PTC's legendary designer John Allen – which opened at Wyandot Lake in 1956 near Powell, Ohio.	「海龍號」(Sea Dragon) 為青少年雲霄飛車的著名典範。這是由 PTC 的傳奇設計師 John Allen 所設計且至今營運歷史最久遠的雲霄飛車，於 1956 年在鄰近俄亥俄州鮑威爾市的懷恩多特湖畔正式亮相。
A hypercoaster, occasionally stylized as hyper coaster, is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least 200 feet (61 m).	超級雲霄飛車 (hypercoaster，有時會分開寫成 hyper coaster) 為高度落差在 200 英尺 (61 公尺) 以上的雲霄飛車。
Moonsault Scramble, which debuted at Fuji-Q Highland in 1984, was the first to break this barrier, though the term hypercoaster was first coined by Cedar Point and Arrow Dynamics with the opening of Magnum XL-200 in 1989.	1984 年在日本富士急樂園 (Fuji-Q Highland) 初次亮相的「銀月瀑布爭霸戰」(Moonsault Scramble) 為首座突破這項高度障礙的雲霄飛車。不過，「超級雲霄飛車」這個詞彙卻是遲至 1989 年才由杉點主題樂園 (Cedar Point) 和箭矢動力公司 (Arrow Dynamics) 在「麥格努姆 XL-200 」雲霄飛車開張時創造出來。
Hypercoasters have become one of the most predominant types of roller coasters in the world, now led by manufacturers Bolliger & Mabillard and Intamin.	超級雲霄飛車現已成為全球首屈一指的主流雲霄飛車類型，Bolliger & Mabillard 和 Intamin 為兩大龍頭製造商。
Salmon eggs are laid in freshwater streams typically at high latitudes.	鮭魚一般會在高緯度地區的淡水河流中產卵。
The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry.	魚卵會孵化出魚苗或囊魚苗。
The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes.	魚苗很快就會長成幼鮭，身上出現五彩斑斕的垂直條紋。
The parr stay for six months to three years in their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily rubbed off.	幼鮭要在自己出生的河流中待上六個月到三年才會變成銀色小鮭魚，身上會出現明亮的銀白色以及容易刮除的魚鱗。
Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage.	據估計只有一成的鮭魚卵能夠存活到這個階段。
The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water.	銀色小鮭魚體內的化學物質產生變化，讓牠們能夠在鹽水裡生活。
While a few species of salmon remain in fresh water throughout their life cycle, the majority are anadromous and migrate to the ocean for maturation: in these species, smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean.	雖然有少數幾種鮭魚一輩子都離不開淡水環境，但多數鮭魚都會迴游並會遷徙到海中成長為成魚。這些種類的銀色小鮭魚會在遷徙入海的過程中到半鹹水裡待上一段時間，好讓體內的化學物質逐漸適應海水的滲透壓。
The salmon spend about one to five years (depending on the species) in the open ocean, where they gradually become sexually mature.	鮭魚會在大海中待上一到五年 (視品種而有所不同)，在此漸漸達到性成熟。
The adult salmon then return primarily to their natal streams to spawn.	成年的鮭魚隨後會洄游而上，主要是為了回到出生地產卵。
Atlantic salmon spend between one and four years at sea.	大西洋鮭會在海中待上一到四年。
When a fish returns after just one year's sea feeding, it is called a grilse in Canada, Britain, and Ireland. Grilse may be present at spawning, and go unnoticed by large males, releasing their own sperm on the eggs.	加拿大、英國和愛爾蘭會稱呼在海中僅待滿一年就洄游而上的鮭魚為「年輕鮭魚」(grilse)。年輕鮭魚會出現在產卵地點，然後趁大型雄魚不注意的時候，將自己的精子撒在卵上。
Prior to spawning, depending on the species, salmon undergo changes.	鮭魚會視品種不同在產卵之前有所轉變。
They may grow a hump, develop canine-like teeth, or develop a kype (a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male salmon).	牠們可能會背部隆起、長出尖牙或是下顎變得更發達 (雄鮭魚的下顎會更加突出)。
All change from the silvery blue of a fresh-run fish from the sea to a darker colour.	所有鮭魚都會從銀藍色的淡水魚轉變成深色的海魚。
Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids to reproduce.	鮭魚的旅程可說是令人敬佩萬分，有時候會逆流而上數百英里，為了繁衍後代不惜力抗強勁水流和急流。
Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho, for example, travel over 1,400 km (900 mi) and climb nearly 2,100 m (7,000 ft) from the Pacific Ocean as they return to spawn.	例如來自愛達荷州中部的帝王鮭和紅鮭，牠們會從太平洋逆流而行超過 1,400 公里 (約 900 英里) 並攀躍至將近 2,100 公尺 (約 7,000 英尺) 的山上產卵。
Condition tends to deteriorate the longer the fish remain in fresh water, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn, when they are known as kelts.	鮭魚在淡水裡待越久，身體狀況就會越來越差，到了產卵之後更是每況愈下。這時候的鮭魚會被稱為「產後鮭」(kelt)。
In all species of Pacific salmon, the mature individuals die within a few days or weeks of spawning, a trait known as semelparity.	所有品種的太平洋鮭魚都會在成熟並產卵後的數天或數週內死亡，這樣的特徵稱為「單次繁殖」(semelparity)。
Between 2 and 4% of Atlantic salmon kelts survive to spawn again, all females.	在所有雌性鮭魚當中，只有 2% 到 4% 的大西洋產後鮭魚能夠活到再次產卵。
However, even in those species of salmon that may survive to spawn more than once (iteroparity), postspawning mortality is quite high (perhaps as high as 40 to 50%).	然而，即使這些品種的鮭魚能夠活著產卵一次以上 (多次繁殖)，產卵後的死亡率也相當高 (約莫四成到五成)。
To lay her roe, the female salmon uses her tail (caudal fin), to create a low-pressure zone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, excavating a shallow depression, called a redd.	雌鮭魚會為了產卵用自己的尾巴 (尾鰭) 拍打出一個低壓區，揚起碎石讓河流沖走，清理出一個名為「產卵區」(redd) 的淺坑。
The redd may sometimes contain 5,000 eggs covering 2.8 m² (30 sq ft).	產卵區有時可容納 5,000 顆魚卵，面積達 2.8 平方公尺 (約 30 平方英尺)。
The eggs usually range from orange to red.	魚卵的顏色通常介於橘色到紅色之間。
One or more males approach the female in her redd, depositing sperm, or milt, over the roe.	會有一隻以上的雄鮭魚游到待在自己的產卵區內的雌鮭魚身邊，將精子或精液撒在魚卵上。
The female then covers the eggs by disturbing the gravel at the upstream edge of the depression before moving on to make another redd.	雌鮭魚接著會將淺坑上游側的碎石撥過來蓋住魚卵，然後再去挖出另一個產卵區。
The female may make as many as seven redds before her supply of eggs is exhausted.	雌鮭魚在耗盡自己產出的魚卵之前，最多可完成七個產卵區。
Each year, the fish experiences a period of rapid growth, often in summer, and one of slower growth, normally in winter.	每一年，鮭魚通常會在夏季迎來快速成長期，然後成長速度一般會在冬季趨緩。
This results in ring formation around an earbone called the otolith (annuli), analogous to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk.	這會造成魚類耳石 (otolith) 的環狀紋路 (年輪)，類似在樹幹中會見到隨著年齡增長而出現的環狀紋路。
Freshwater growth shows as densely crowded rings, sea growth as widely spaced rings; spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is converted into eggs and milt.	在淡水環境中的生長年輪紋路十分密集，在海洋環境中的生長年輪紋路則間隙較寬。產卵期會出現明顯的紋路痕跡，因為其身體質量會在這時期轉化為魚卵和精液。
Freshwater streams and estuaries provide important habitat for many salmon species.	淡水河流和河口區域為許多鮭魚品種提供了重要的棲地環境。
They feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young, and primarily on other fish when older.	這些鮭魚會在幼年時以陸地和水中的昆蟲、端足蟲和其他甲殼類動物為食，成年後則主要以其他魚類為獵食對象。
Eggs are laid in deeper water with larger gravel, and need cool water and good water flow (to supply oxygen) to the developing embryos.	魚卵會產在碎石顆粒較大的深水區，並且需要沁涼且流動狀況良好 (利於供氧) 的水域環境來協助胚胎生長。
Mortality of salmon in the early life stages is usually high due to natural predation and human-induced changes in habitat, such as siltation, high water temperatures, low oxygen concentration, loss of stream cover, and reductions in river flow.	處於幼年階段的鮭魚，由於會遇到自然界中的掠食者以及土石淤積、水溫過高、氧氣濃度不足、缺少溪流蔽蔭以及河川流量減少等人為造成的棲地環境變遷，死亡率通常居高不下。
Estuaries and their associated wetlands provide vital nursery areas for the salmon prior to their departure to the open ocean.	在鮭魚離開棲地前往廣闊海洋之前，河口地區及鄰近相連的濕地可提供至關重要的養育環境。
Wetlands not only help buffer the estuary from silt and pollutants, but also provide important feeding and hiding areas.	濕地不僅能協助緩解河口地區的淤積及汙染危害，也能提供重要的覓食及蔽蔭區域。
Salmon not killed by other means show greatly accelerated deterioration (phenoptosis, or "programmed aging") at the end of their lives.	倖免於難而存活下來的鮭魚，在生命走到盡頭時會出現急遽劣化 (衰亡，或稱作「程式性老化」)。
Their bodies rapidly deteriorate right after they spawn as a result of the release of massive amounts of corticosteroids.	牠們的身體會因為在產卵期間釋出了大量的皮質類固醇而快速劣化。
In the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, salmon are keystone species, supporting wildlife such as birds, bears and otters.	鮭魚為太平洋西北部海域和阿拉斯加地區的關鍵物種，讓當地的鳥類、熊類和其他野生物種得以存續。
The bodies of salmon represent a transfer of nutrients from the ocean, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, to the forest ecosystem.	鮭魚的身體富含氮、硫、碳和磷等元素，為將海洋中的營養素轉移至森林生態系統中的代表物種。
Grizzly bears function as ecosystem engineers, capturing salmon and carrying them into adjacent wooded areas.	灰熊會捕食鮭魚並將鮭魚帶到鄰近的林地區域，其作用相當於生態系統工程師。
There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and feces and partially eaten carcasses.	牠們會在林地排泄富含營養素的尿液和糞便，以及沒吃完的鮭魚殘骸。
Bears are estimated to leave up to half the salmon they harvest on the forest floor, in densities that can reach 4,000 kilograms per hectare, providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the riparian woodlands.	據估算，熊在林地間遺棄的鮭魚殘骸數量可達原先捕獲量的一半，密度達到每公頃 4,000 公斤，最多可提供岸邊林地 24% 的有效氮含量。
The foliage of spruce trees up to 500 m (1,600 ft) from a stream where grizzlies fish salmon have been found to contain nitrogen originating from fished salmon.	在灰熊捕食鮭魚的溪流附近，有人發現高達 500 公尺 (1.600 英尺) 的雲杉樹樹葉中含有源自於鮭魚殘骸的氮元素。
It has been discovered that rivers which have seen a decline or disappearance of anadromous lampreys, loss of the lampreys also affects the salmon in a negative way.	有些河川出現了洄游性七鰓鰻數量減少或消失無蹤等狀況，這也會對鮭魚造成負面影響。
Like salmon, anadromous lampreys stop feeding and die after spawning, and their decomposing bodies release nutrients into the stream.	洄游性七鰓鰻和鮭魚一樣會在產卵後不再覓食並邁向死亡，並在遺骸分解後將營養素釋放到溪流中。
Also, along with species like rainbow trout and Sacramento sucker, lampreys clean the gravel in the rivers during spawning.	此外，七鰓鰻和虹鱒及沙加緬度亞口魚一樣會在產卵時清除河中碎石。
Their larvae, called ammocoetes, are filter feeders which contribute to the health of the waters.	其幼體名為沙隱蟲，為濾食性動物，可協助維護水域的健康狀態。
They are also a food source for the young salmon, and being fattier and oilier, it is assumed predators prefer them over salmon offspring, taking off some of the predation pressure on smolts.	沙隱蟲也是幼年鮭魚的食物來源之一，而且因為沙隱蟲比鮭魚幼苗更為肥美，理應會更受掠食者喜愛，進而分擔了幼鮭遭到掠食的生存壓力。
Adult lampreys are also the preferred prey of seals and sea lions, which can eat 30 lampreys to every salmon, allowing more adult salmon to enter the rivers to spawn without being eaten by the marine mammals.	成年的七鰓鰻也是較受海豹和海獅喜愛的獵物，後者每多捕食 30 條七鰓鰻就會少捕食 1 尾鮭魚，進而讓更多成年鮭魚得以游回河中產卵，免遭海洋哺乳類大快朵頤。
According to Canadian biologist Dorothy Kieser, the myxozoan parasite Henneguya salminicola is commonly found in the flesh of salmonids.	據加拿大生物學家 Dorothy Kieser 指出，鮭生黏孢子蟲 (Henneguya salminicola) 為鮭魚魚肉中常見的黏體寄生蟲。
It has been recorded in the field samples of salmon returning to the Haida Gwaii Islands.	這類寄生蟲可見於返回海達瓜依群島 (Haida Gwaii Islands) 的鮭魚田調樣本紀錄中。
The fish responds by walling off the parasitic infection into a number of cysts that contain milky fluid.	鮭魚體內會設法將受到寄生蟲感染的部位圍堵起來，進而形成數個內含乳白色液體的囊腫。
This fluid is an accumulation of a large number of parasites.	該乳白色液體中積聚了大量寄生蟲。
Henneguya and other parasites in the myxosporean group have complex life cycles, where the salmon is one of two hosts.	黏孢子蟲和其他同屬黏體動物的寄生蟲都有著複雜的生命週期，而鮭魚是其雙宿主之一。
The fish releases the spores after spawning.	感染後的魚會在產卵後釋放孢子。
In the Henneguya case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream.	舉黏孢子蟲為例，其孢子會在這時進入到第二位宿主體內，大部分會是產卵溪流中的無脊椎動物。
When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon.	當年幼鮭魚遷居至太平洋時，第二位宿主就會隨之進入鮭魚傳染階段。
The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle.	接著寄生蟲就會待在鮭魚體內，直到下一次產卵週期到來為止，
The myxosporean parasite that causes whirling disease in trout has a similar life cycle.	會導致鱒魚染上迴旋病 (whirling disease) 的黏體寄生蟲有著類似的生命週期。
However, as opposed to whirling disease, the Henneguya infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon—even heavily infected fish tend to return to spawn successfully.	然而，黏孢子蟲卻反其道而行，它並不會導致其鮭魚宿主染疫，鮭魚即使重度感染還是能夠順利洄游產卵。
According to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on Henneguya salminicola was done by scientists at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report which states, "the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections.	據 Kieser 博士指出，早在 1980 年代中期，位於納奈莫 (Nanaimo) 的太平洋生物研究站 (Pacific Biological Station) 中就有科學家針對黏孢子蟲進行了許多研究，尤其是在一份綜覽報告中指出：「幼年時期在淡水棲地的居住時間最長的鮭魚，其感染狀況最為明顯。」
Hence in order of prevalence, coho are most infected followed by sockeye, chinook, chum and pink.	因此，若依感染盛行率排序，則銀鮭最容易遭到感染，再來是紅鉤吻鮭、帝王鮭、鉤吻鮭和粉紅鮭。
As well, the report says, at the time the studies were conducted, stocks from the middle and upper reaches of large river systems in British Columbia such as Fraser, Skeena, Nass and from mainland coastal streams in the southern half of B.C., "are more likely to have a low prevalence of infection." The report also states, "It should be stressed that Henneguya, economically deleterious though it is, is harmless from the view of public health.	報告中提到，在進行研究當下，位於英屬哥倫比亞境內大河流域 (如弗雷澤河、斯基納河、納斯河等) 的上、中游區以及來自南部沿海溪流的魚群「均可能有較低的感染盛行率」。報告中也提到：「儘管黏孢子蟲在經濟方面會造成危害，但我們也應強調其並不會危害到公共衛生。
It is strictly a fish parasite that cannot live in or affect warm blooded animals, including man".	這是只有魚類會感染到的寄生蟲，無法在如人類般的溫血動物體內存活或造成影響」。
According to Klaus Schallie, Molluscan Shellfish Program Specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, "Henneguya salminicola is found in southern B.C. also and in all species of salmon.	據與加拿大食品檢驗局合作的軟殼貝類監管計劃專家 Klaus Schallie 出：「黏孢子蟲也有在英屬哥倫比亞南部出現，而且所有品種的鮭魚無一倖免。
I have previously examined smoked chum salmon sides that were riddled with cysts and some sockeye runs in Barkley Sound (southern B.C., west coast of Vancouver Island) are noted for their high incidence of infestation."	我之前檢驗了上面滿是囊腫的煙燻秋鮭切片，以及在巴克利灣 (位於英屬哥倫比亞南部及溫哥華島西岸) 出沒且以高感染率聞名的紅鉤吻鮭。」
Sea lice, particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis and various Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon.	海蝨，尤其是鮭魚蝨和各種魚蝨 (包含 C. clemensi 和 C. rogercresseyi 等品種) 會對人工養殖和野生鮭魚造成致命的感染危害。
Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days.	海蝨為體外寄生蟲，以黏液、血液和皮膚為食。它會在游離、浮游體和橈足體等階段遷徙並牢牢附生在野生鮭魚的表皮上，時間可長達好幾天。
Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms	大量且高度群聚的開放式鮭魚養殖場
can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result.	可能會聚集數量異常龐大的海蝨。有許多年幼的野生鮭魚在接觸到闢建了大量開放式養殖場的河口地區後，會接連受到感染並因此喪命。
Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable.	成年鮭魚可在數量達到臨界值的海蝨群中存活下來，但個頭嬌小、表皮細薄且剛剛遷徙到海洋中的幼年鮭魚則十分脆弱。
On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%.	在加拿大的太平洋沿岸，有些地區的粉紅鮭的蝨害死亡率往往都會超過八成。
The risk of injury caused by underwater pile driving has been studied by Dr. Halvorsen and her co-workers.	Halvorsen 博士和她的同事共同研究了水下打樁作業導致魚群受傷的風險。
The study concluded that the fish are at risk of injury if the cumulative sound exposure level exceeds 210 dB relative to 1 μPa² s.	研究結果顯示，如果累計噪音暴露位準超過 210 分貝 (re. 1 μPa² s)，就會產生魚群受傷的風險。
As can be seen from the production chart at the left, the global capture reported by different countries to the FAO of commercial wild salmon has remained fairly steady since 1990 at about one million tonnes per year.	如左方生產圖表所示，自 1990 年以來，世界各國向聯合國糧食及農業組織 (FAO) 回報的商用野生鮭魚捕獲量均維持在每年約一百萬噸，相當穩定，
This is in contrast to farmed salmon (below) which has increased in the same period from about 0.6 million tonnes to well over two million tonnes.	人工養殖的鮭魚則大相逕庭 (請見下方圖表)，在同樣一段時間內從約六十萬噸成長至超過二百萬噸。
Nearly all captured wild salmon are Pacific salmon.	幾乎所有被捕獲的野生鮭魚都是太平洋鮭魚。
The capture of wild Atlantic salmon has always been relatively small, and has declined steadily since 1990.	大西洋野生鮭魚的捕獲量一直以來都不多，而且從 1990 年以來每況愈下。
In 2011 only 2,500 tonnes were reported.	在 2011 年僅回報了 2,500 噸。
In contrast about half of all farmed salmon are Atlantic salmon.	相比之下，有半數的人工養殖鮭魚為大西洋鮭魚。
Recreational salmon fishing can be a technically demanding kind of sport fishing, not necessarily congenial for beginning fishermen.	釣鮭魚為相當需要技巧的休閒釣魚活動，對於初學者而言不太好上手。
A conflict exists between commercial fishermen and recreational fishermen for the right to salmon stock resources.	漁民和釣客之間在捕撈鮭魚魚群資源的權利方面有所衝突。
Commercial fishing in estuaries and coastal areas is often restricted so enough salmon can return to their natal rivers where they can spawn and be available for sport fishing.	在河口及岸邊區域的漁業活動通常會有所限制，好讓足量的鮭魚能夠返回原生河流產卵並提供休閒漁業所需。
On parts of the North American west coast sport salmon fishing completely replaces inshore commercial fishing.	在北美西岸，有部分地區的釣鮭魚休閒產業完全取代了近海漁業。
In most cases, the commercial value of a salmon can be several times less than the value attributed to the same fish caught by a sport fisherman.	在大多數情況下，同一尾鮭魚的商業價值會比讓休閒釣客捕撈所能貢獻的價值還要低上好幾倍。
This is "a powerful economic argument for allocating stock resources preferentially to sport fishing."	這項「經濟論證鏗鏘有力，支持將魚群資源優先分配給休閒漁業」。
Salmon aquaculture is a major contributor to the world production of farmed finfish, representing about US$10 billion annually.	鮭魚養殖為全球養殖漁業的主力大戶，每年產值約一百億美元。
Other commonly cultured fish species include tilapia, catfish, sea bass, carp and bream.	其他養殖漁業常見的魚種包括吳郭魚、鯰魚、鱸魚、鯉魚和魴魚等。
Salmon farming is significant in Chile, Norway, Scotland, Canada and the Faroe Islands; it is the source for most salmon consumed in the United States and Europe.	智利、挪威、蘇格蘭、加拿大和法羅群島等地的鮭魚養殖業十分盛行，為美國和歐洲大部分市售鮭魚的貨源。
Atlantic salmon are also, in very small volumes, farmed in Russia and Tasmania, Australia.	在俄國和l澳洲的塔斯馬尼亞州等地也有人在養殖大西洋鮭魚 (但數量很少)。
Salmon are carnivorous.	鮭魚為肉食性動物。
They are fed a meal produced from catching other wild fish and other marine organisms.	牠們會以捕捉到的其他野生魚類和海洋生物為食。
Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild forage fish.	鮭魚養殖需要大量的野生餌料魚。
Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product.	鮭魚需要攝取大量的蛋白質來補充營養，而養殖漁場中的鮭魚會消耗掉比最終成魚肉量還要多的餌料魚。
On a dry weight basis, 2–4 kg of wild-caught fish are needed to produce one kg of salmon.	以淨重計算，要產出一公斤的鮭魚肉，會需要捕撈二至四公斤的野生魚類。
As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield.	隨著鮭魚養殖產業規模擴展，野生餌料魚的需求量也越來越大，全球各地受到監控的漁場一度有七成五已經接近或超過其最大永續產量。
The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.	鮭魚養殖產業大規模捕撈野生餌料魚，影響到仰賴餌料魚為食的野生掠食魚種的生存能力。
Work continues on substituting vegetable proteins for animal proteins in the salmon diet.	目前還在繼續嘗試以植物蛋白質替代鮭魚飲食中的動物蛋白質。
This substitution results in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 fatty acid content in the farmed product.	結果替代飲食導致養殖魚肉中珍貴的 Omega-3 脂肪酸含量減少。
Intensive salmon farming uses open-net cages, which have low production costs.	密集養殖的鮭魚漁場會使用開放式箱網，其生產成本低廉。
Persea americana is a tree that grows to 20 m (66 ft), with alternately arranged leaves 12–25 cm (4.7–9.8 in) long.	酪梨樹可成長至 20 公尺 (66 英尺) 高，具有互生葉序的樹葉可長達 12-25 公分 (4.7-9.8 英吋)。
Panicles of flowers with deciduous bracts arise from new growth or the axils of leaves.	具圓錐花序且苞片易落的新生花苞會從葉腋間冒出來。
The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, 5–10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) wide.	花苞本身並不顯眼，花色黃中帶綠，寬度 5-10 公釐 (約 0.2-0.4 英吋)。
The species is variable because of selection pressure by humans to produce larger, fleshier fruits with a thinner exocarp.	人們為了產出更大、果肉更厚實且果皮更薄透的果實，在選擇壓力下造就了各式各樣的品種。
The avocado fruit is a climacteric, single-seeded berry, due to the imperceptible endocarp covering the seed, rather than a drupe.	酪梨果為更年型的單子漿果，其種子外表有一層難以察覺的內果皮，而非核果。
The pear-shaped fruit is 7–20 cm (2.8–7.9 in) long, weighs between 100 and 1,000 g (3.5 and 35.3 oz), and has a large central seed, 5–6.4 cm (2.0–2.5 in) long.	這種梨形水果的長度為 7-20 公分 (約 2.8-7.9 英吋)，重量介於 100 克至 1,000 克之間 (約 3.5 盎司至 35.3 盎司之間)，中間還有顆長達 5-6.4 公分的碩大種子。
Persea americana, or the avocado, possibly originated in the Tehuacan Valley in the state of Puebla, Mexico, although fossil evidence suggests similar species were much more widespread millions of years ago.	酪梨很有可能起源自墨西哥普埃布拉州的提瓦坎谷中，儘管化石佐證了類似的品種早已在數百萬年前遍及更加廣闊的地帶。
However, there is evidence for three possible separate domestications of the avocado, resulting in the currently recognized Mexican (aoacatl), Guatemalan (quilaoacatl), and West Indian (tlacacolaocatl) landraces.	然而，有證據指出三處可能的酪梨馴化培育地點，造就出目前可分辨出來的墨西哥種 (aoactl)、瓜地馬拉種 (quilaoacatl) 及西印度種 (tlacacolaocatl) 等地方品種。
The Mexican and Guatemalan landraces originated in the highlands of those countries, while the West Indian landrace is a lowland variety that ranges from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador to Peru, achieving a wide range through human agency before the arrival of the Europeans.	墨西哥種和瓜地馬拉種起源自這兩個國家的高地區域，西印度種則遍及瓜地馬拉、哥斯大黎加、哥倫比亞、厄瓜多及祕魯等地的低地區域，在歐洲人抵達之前透過人為傳播達成大範圍的種植成果。
The three separate landraces were most likely to have already intermingled in pre-Columbian America and were described in the Florentine Codex.	這三種不同的地方品種很有可能在哥倫布造訪美洲之前就混雜在一起，並記載於「佛羅倫斯手抄本」(Florentine Codex) 中。
The earliest residents were living in temporary camps in an ancient wetland eating avocados, chilies, mollusks, sharks, birds, and sea lions.	最早期的居民住在古老濕地上的臨時聚落，以酪梨、辣椒、軟體動物、鯊魚、鳥類和海獅為食。
The oldest discovery of an avocado pit comes from Coxcatlan Cave, dating from around 9,000 to 10,000 years ago.	目前發現年代最久遠的酪梨籽來自卡克斯凱特洞穴 (Coxcatlan Cave)，可追溯至約九千至一萬年前。
Other caves in the Tehuacan Valley from around the same time period also show early evidence for the presence of avocado.	其他位於提瓦坎谷區且年代相近的洞穴內也都有證據佐證早年的酪梨蹤影。
There is evidence for avocado use at Norte Chico civilization sites in Peru by at least 3,200 years ago and at Caballo Muerto in Peru from around 3,800 to 4,500 years ago.	祕魯的小北文明 (Norte Chico) 聚落遺址有至少 3,200 年前的酪梨食用證據，該國的卡巴羅穆爾托 (Caballo Muerto) 遺址則出土了大約 3,800 年至 4,500 年前的佐證物件。
The native, undomesticated variety is known as a criollo, and is small, with dark black skin, and contains a large seed.	未經人類馴化的原生種稱為克里奧羅種 (criollo)，體積小且表皮顏色深黑，果實內有碩大的種子。
It probably coevolved with extinct megafauna.	它有可能是與絕種的巨型動物共同演化而來。
The avocado tree also has a long history of cultivation in Central and South America, likely beginning as early as 5,000 BC.	酪梨果樹在中美洲及南美洲等地區有著悠久的栽種歷史，最早可追溯至西元前 5,000 年。
A water jar shaped like an avocado, dating to AD 900, was discovered in the pre-Incan city of Chan Chan.	在印加帝國之前的昌昌 (Chan Chan) 古城內出土了一個西元 900 年的酪梨型水壺。
The earliest known written account of the avocado in Europe is that of Martín Fernández de Enciso (circa 1470–1528) in 1519 in his book, Suma De Geographia Que Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo.	目前已知歐洲最早提及酪梨的文獻為 Martín Fernández de Enciso (1470–1528) 於 1519 年出版的《世界地理大全》(Suma De Geographia Que Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo)。
The first detailed account that unequivocally describes the avocado was given by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés in his work Sumario de la natural historia de las Indias in 1526.	首篇鉅細靡遺描寫酪梨的文獻則為 Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés 於 1526 年出版的《西印度群島自然史概述》(Sumario de la natural historia de las Indias)。
The first written record in English of the use of the word 'avocado' was by Hans Sloane, who coined the term, in a 1696 index of Jamaican plants.	英文中的酪梨 (avocado) 首見於 1696 年出版的《牙買加植物索引》(Index of Jamaican Plants)，由 Hans Sloane 創造出來。
The plant was introduced to Spain in 1601, Indonesia around 1750, Mauritius in 1780, Brazil in 1809, the United States mainland in 1825, South Africa and Australia in the late 19th century, and Israel in 1908.	酪梨於 1601 年引進到西班牙，約莫於 1750 年來到印尼、於 1780 年至模里西斯、1809 年至巴西、1825 年紮根美國、十九世紀晚期來到南非和澳洲，並於 1908 年引進到以色列。
In the United States, the avocado was introduced to Florida and Hawaii in 1833 and in California in 1856.	在美國境內，佛羅里達州及夏威夷均於 1833 年引進酪梨，加州則於 1856 年引進。
Before 1915, the avocado was commonly referred to in California as ahuacate and in Florida as alligator pear.	在 1915 年之前，加州人通常將酪梨稱為「ahuacate/aguacate」，佛州人則稱之為鱷梨 (alligator pear)。
In 1915, the California Avocado Association introduced the then-innovative term avocado to refer to the plant.	1915 年，加州酪梨協會將當時仍相當新穎的「avocado」一詞介紹給普羅大眾，當作正式名稱。
The word "avocado" comes from the Spanish aguacate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ], which goes back to the proto-Aztecan *pa:wa which also meant "avocado".	「avocado」一詞源自於西班牙文中的「aguacate」，再往前可追溯至納瓦特爾語 (Nahuatl) 的「āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ]」，追本溯源則為原始阿茲特克語中的「*pa:wa」，即現今的「酪梨」之意。
Sometimes the Nahuatl word was used with the meaning "testicle", probably because of the likeness between the fruit and the body part.	納瓦特爾語中的酪梨有時候會用來指稱「睪丸」，有可能是因為這種水果長得很像該身體部位。
The modern English name comes from an English rendering of the Spanish aguacate as avogato.	現代的英文名稱則是將西班牙文中的「aguacate」轉譯為「avogato」而來。
The earliest known written use in English is attested from 1697 as "avogato pear", a term which was later corrupted as "alligator pear".	經證實，目前已知最早曾於 1697 在英文的書面文獻中出現「avogato pear」一詞，之後則誤植為「alligator pear」(鱷梨)。
Because the word avogato sounded like "advocate", several languages reinterpreted it to have that meaning.	因為「avogato」一詞唸起來音似「倡議」(advocate)，有些語言會據此重新詮釋該詞含意。
French uses avocat, which also means lawyer, and "advocate" — forms of the word appear in several Germanic languages, such as the (now obsolete) German Advogato-Birne, the old Danish advokat-pære (today it is called avocado) and the Dutch advocaatpeer.	法文會使用「avocat」來指稱酪梨，該詞同時也有「律師」和「倡議」之意。該詞語的變形也出現在數種日耳曼語系的語言當中，諸如德文的「酪梨」為「Advogato-Birne」(現已過時)、丹麥文的酪梨舊稱為「advokat-pære」(現今已更名為「avocado」)，荷蘭文則是「advocaatpeer」。
In other Central American and Caribbean Spanish-speaking countries, it is known by the Mexican name, while South American Spanish-speaking countries use a Quechua-derived word, palta.	在中美洲以及加勒比海地區的其他西語系國家都使用墨西哥文稱呼酪梨，南美洲的西語系國家則使用源自克丘亞語 (Quenchua) 的「palta」。
In Portuguese, it is abacate.	葡萄牙文中的酪梨為「abacate」。
The fruit is sometimes called an avocado pear or alligator pear (due to its shape and the rough green skin of some cultivars).	該水果有時會被稱為「睪梨」或「鱷梨」(因為其形似睪丸，且某些品種具有粗糙的綠色果皮)。
The Nahuatl āhuacatl can be compounded with other words, as in ahuacamolli, meaning avocado soup or sauce, from which the Spanish word guacamole derives.	納瓦特爾語的「āhuacatl」可以和其他詞語組成複合詞，比如「ahuacamolli」(意思是酪梨湯或酪梨醬汁)。西班牙文中的「酪梨醬」(guacamole) 即源自於此。
In the United Kingdom, the term avocado pear is still sometimes misused as applied when avocados first became commonly available in the 1960s.	當酪梨於 1960 年代首度成為英國常見的蔬果之後，仍然時而有人誤用「avocado pear」(睪梨) 一詞稱之。
Originating as a diminutive in Australian English, a clipped form, avo, has since become a common colloquialism in South Africa and the United Kingdom.	「avo」原為澳洲英文用來簡稱酪梨的省略語，後來成為南非及英國常見的口語詞彙。
It is known as "butter fruit" in parts of India.	酪梨在印度境內的部分地區有「奶油果」之稱。
The subtropical species needs a climate without frost and with little wind.	這種副熱帶水果需要不會結霜且有微風拂面而來的氣候。
High winds reduce the humidity, dehydrate the flowers, and affect pollination.	疾風吹拂會讓濕度降低，導致花苞脫水，進而影響授粉。
When even a mild frost occurs, premature fruit drop may occur, although the 'Hass' cultivar can tolerate temperatures down to −1 °C.	儘管哈斯 (Hass) 酪梨已經可以忍受攝氏零下 1 度的低溫，但即便只有輕微結霜，還是有可能發生提早落果的現象。
Several cold-hardy varieties are planted in the region of Gainesville, Florida, which survive temperatures as low as −6.5 °C (20 °F) with only minor leaf damage.	有些耐寒的品種會種植在佛羅里達州的蓋恩斯維爾 (Gainesville) 地區，能夠在攝氏零下 6.5 度 (華氏 20 度) 的低溫下存活，僅有少數葉子會為此凋萎。
The trees also need well-aerated soils, ideally more than 1 m deep.	果樹本身也需要透氣良好的土壤，理想深度為 1 公尺以上。
According to information published by the Water Footprint Network, it takes an average of approximately 70 litres (18 US gal) of applied fresh ground or surface water, not including rainfall or natural moisture in the soil, to grow one avocado.	據水足跡網絡 (Water Footprint Network) 公開發佈的資訊指出，要種出一株酪梨，平均需要用到大約 70 公升 (約 18 加侖) 的地下或地面的淡水，不包括降雨或土壤中自然含有的水分。
However, the amount of water needed depends on where it is grown; for example, in the main avocado-growing region of Chile, about 320 litres (85 US gal) of applied water are needed to grow one avocado.	然而，所需水量仍取決於生長地區。例如在智利境內的主要酪梨種植區，要種植一株酪梨所需要用到的水量大約是 320 公升 (85 加侖)。
Yield is reduced when the irrigation water is highly saline.	若灌溉用水的鹽分含量高，則產量會隨之減少。
These soil and climate conditions are available in southern and eastern Colombia, Morocco, the Levant, South Africa, Venezuela, Spain, Peru, parts of central and northern Chile, Vietnam, Indonesia, parts of southern India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, southern California, Arizona, Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, Hawaii, Ecuador, and Rwanda.	具有這些土壤和氣候條件的地區有哥倫比亞南部和東部地區、摩洛哥、黎凡特地區 (the Levant)、南非、委內瑞拉、西班牙、祕魯、智利中部和北部的部分地區、越南、印尼、印度南部的部分地區、斯里蘭卡、澳洲、紐西蘭、菲律賓、馬來西亞、中美洲、加勒比海地區、墨西哥、南加州、亞利桑那州、波多黎各、德州、佛羅里達州、夏威夷、厄瓜多和盧安達等。
Each region has different cultivars.	每一個地區都有各自不同的品種。
Commercial orchards produce an average of seven tonnes per hectare each year, with some orchards achieving 20 tonnes per hectare.	商業果園的平均產量為每年每公頃七公噸，有些果園的產量可達到每公頃二十公噸。
Biennial bearing can be a problem, with heavy crops in one year being followed by poor yields the next.	二年生植物的特性可能會造成問題，導致某一年盛產但隔年卻產量銳減。
Like the banana, the avocado is a climacteric fruit, which matures on the tree, but ripens off the tree.	酪梨和香蕉一樣都是更年型水果，會在樹上逐漸成熟，但要在採摘下來之後才會熟透。
Avocados used in commerce are picked hard and green and kept in coolers at 3.3 to 5.6 °C (37.9 to 42.1 °F) until they reach their final destination.	在市面上販售的酪梨會趁果肉生硬且表皮青綠時摘下來，然後冷藏在攝氏 3.3 度至 5.6 度 (華氏 37.9 度至 42.1 度) 中，直到抵達最終站。
Avocados must be mature to ripen properly.	酪梨必須在妥善條件下從成熟至熟透。
Avocados that fall off the tree ripen on the ground.	從樹上掉落的酪梨會在地上熟透腐爛。
Generally, the fruit is picked once it reaches maturity; Mexican growers pick 'Hass' avocados when they have more than 23% dry matter, and other producing countries have similar standards.	通常來說，這種水果一旦成熟了就可以摘下來。墨西哥的果農會在哈斯酪梨的乾物質比例達 23% 以上的時候把它摘下來，其他酪梨生產國也有類似的採摘標準。
Once picked, avocados ripen in one to two weeks (depending on the cultivar) at room temperature (faster if stored with other fruits such as apples or bananas, because of the influence of ethylene gas).	在摘下來之後，室溫下的酪梨會在一至二週內熟透 (取決於酪梨品種。如果和蘋果或香蕉之類的水果一同儲存，會因為釋放出乙烯氣體的關係而加快熟成速度)。
Some supermarkets sell ripened avocados which have been treated with synthetic ethylene to hasten ripening.	有些超市會販售以合成乙烯加快熟成速度的完熟酪梨。
The use of an ethylene gas "ripening room", which is now an industry standard, was pioneered in the 1980s by farmer Gil Henry of Escondido, California, in response to footage from a hidden supermarket camera which showed shoppers repeatedly squeezing hard, unripe avocados, putting them "back in the bin," and moving on without making a purchase.	使用乙烯氣體的「熟成室」如今已是業界的標準配備，當初是在 1980 年代由加州艾斯康迪多市 (Escondido) 的農民 Gil Henry 開創先河。他在超市的隱藏攝影機畫面中看到顧客重複捏著尚未熟透的硬酪梨，接著把酪梨「物歸原位」，連一顆都不買就繼續往前走，因此才起心動念。
In some cases, avocados can be left on the tree for several months, which is an advantage to commercial growers who seek the greatest return for their crop, but if the fruit remains unpicked for too long, it falls to the ground.	在某些情況下，酪梨可以在樹上待好幾個月，這有利於為自己的農作物尋求最佳報酬的農民。但如果隔了太久仍未採收，果實還是會落地。
Avocados can be propagated by seed, taking roughly four to six years to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing.	酪梨可以透過種子繁殖，大約四到六年就會結果，不過在某些狀況下，種子種下去後會花上十年才會結出果實。
The offspring is unlikely to be identical to the parent cultivar in fruit quality.	子代結出的果實品質不見得會與同品種的親代一模一樣。
Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to rootstocks that are propagated by seed (seedling rootstocks) or by layering (clonal rootstocks).	因此，優質品種要靠嫁接到由種子繁殖 (實生砧木) 或壓條繁殖 (營養砧木) 的砧木來繁衍後代。
After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young rootstocks are ready to be grafted.	大約在溫室中栽植一年後，年輕的砧木就可以準備進行嫁接了。
Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used.	頂端嫁接和側腹嫁接為常用的嫁接方法。
The scion cultivar grows for another 6–12 months before the tree is ready to be sold.	接穗品種的幼枝會再栽植 6 至 12 個月才能準備全株出售。
Clonal rootstocks are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor soil aeration or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by Phytophthora.	營養砧木會在需要耐受特定的土壤及疾患條件時雀屏中選，例如土壤的透氣條件不佳，或是要抵禦由疫病菌 (Phytophthora) 造成的土壤病害 (根腐病)。
Commercial avocado production is limited to a small fraction of the vast genetic diversity in the species.	在五花八門的酪梨品種當中，會進行商業量產的酪梨僅限於一小部分。
Conservation of this genetic diversity has relied largely on field collection, as avocado seeds often do not survive storage in seed banks.	要保存如此多元的基因樣態，大部分得仰賴田野採集，因為酪梨籽通常無法在種子銀行中長久儲存。
This is problematic, as field preservation of living cultivars is expensive, and habitat loss threatens wild cultivars.	這樣其實十分麻煩，因為要在田野間保存各品種的活株，所費不貲，而且棲地喪失也威脅著野生品種的存續。
More recently, an alternate method of conservation has been developed based on cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos with reliable methods for somatic embryogenesis and reconstitution into living trees.	近期以來，有人發展出保存種子的替代方法。該方法的基礎構想為以超低溫保存酪梨的體胚，再透過可靠的體胚形成方法重新培植出活株。
Avocado trees are vulnerable to bacterial, viral, fungal, and nutritional diseases (excesses and deficiencies of key minerals).	酪梨果樹對於細菌、病毒、真菌和營養方面的疾病 (過量攝取或缺乏關鍵的礦物質) 幾無招架之力。
Disease can affect all parts of the plant, causing spotting, rotting, cankers, pitting, and discoloration.	疾病會影響到果樹全株，導致表皮出現斑點、腐爛、潰瘍、凹陷和變色。
Mexico is by far the world's largest avocado growing country, producing several times more than the second largest producer.	目前墨西哥是全球最大的酪梨生產國，其產量是第二大生產國的好幾倍。
In 2013, the total area dedicated to avocado production was 188,723 hectares (415,520 acres), and the harvest was 2.03 million tonnes in 2017.	2013 年，專門用來栽植酪梨的區域總面積達到 188,723 公頃 (約 415,520 英畝)。2017 年，收穫量達到 203 萬公噸。
The states that produce the most are México, Morelos, Nayarit, Puebla, and Michoacan, accounting for 86% of the total.	產量名列前茅的州有墨西哥州、莫雷洛斯州、納亞里特州、普埃布拉州和米卻肯州，加總起來可達到總產量的八成六。
In Michoacán, the cultivation is complicated by the existence of drug cartels that extort protection fees from cultivators.	要在米卻肯州栽種蔬果有相當難度，因為當地的販毒集團會向果農索討保護費。
They are reported to exact 2000 Mexican pesos per hectare from avocado farmers and 1 to 3 pesos/kg of harvested fruit.	據報導指出，酪梨農民每公頃得繳交 2,000 墨西哥披索的保護費，每收成一公斤的酪梨得繳交 1 至 3 披索。
The avocado was introduced from Mexico to California in the 19th century, and has become a successful cash crop.	酪梨於十九世紀從墨西哥引進到加州，並順利成為當地的搖錢樹。
About 59,000 acres (240 km²) – some 95% of United States avocado production – is located in Southern California, with 60% in San Diego County.	大約有 59,000 英畝 (240 平方公里) 的酪梨園 (產量將近為美國酪梨總產量的九成五) 位於南加州，其中有六成位於聖地牙哥郡。
Fallbrook, California claims, without official recognition, the title of "Avocado Capital of the World" (also claimed by the town of Uruapan in Mexico), and both Fallbrook and Carpinteria, California, host annual avocado festivals.	加州的佛布魯克地區自稱為 (尚無官方認證)「世界酪梨之都」(墨西哥的烏魯阿潘鎮也同樣如此自稱)，與加州卡平特里亞市均會舉辦一年一度的酪梨節慶活動。
Avocado is the official fruit of the State of California.	酪梨為加州官方認定的代表水果。
Hass avocado production in Peru encompasses thousands of hectares in central and western Peru.	祕魯的哈斯酪梨產區囊括了中部及西部地區上千公頃的土地。
Peru has now become the largest supplier of avocados imported to the European Union and the second largest supplier to Asia and the United States.	祕魯現已成為歐盟國家第一大進口酪梨供應國，且為亞洲及美國地區的第二大酪梨供應國。
Peru's location near the equator and along the Pacific Ocean creates consistently mild temperatures year round.	祕魯鄰近赤道且位處太平洋沿岸地區，造就當地長年穩定的適溫環境。
The soil is rich and sandy and the towering Andes mountains provide a constant flow of pure water for irrigation.	當地土壤肥沃且土質細緻，高聳的安地斯山脈提供了穩定且純淨的灌溉水源。
Naturally sheltered as it is from heavy rain or freezing temperatures, Peru is an almost perfect climate for the cultivation of avocados.	祕魯的天然環境中既無狂風暴雨也無寒凍低溫，幾乎可說是最適合栽種酪梨的絕佳氣候。
Hass avocados from Peru are seasonally available to consumers from May through September and are promoted under the auspices of the Peruvian Avocado Commission, headquartered in Washington, D.C.	每年五月到九月為祕魯哈斯酪梨的銷售旺季，由總部位於華盛頓特區的祕魯酪梨委員會 (Peruvian Avocado Commission) 負責促銷宣傳等事宜。
Other avocado cultivars include 'Spinks'.	其他酪梨品種還包括了「史賓克斯」(Spinks)。
Historically attested varieties (which may or may not survive among horticulturists) include the 'Challenge', 'Dickinson', 'Kist', 'Queen', 'Rey', 'Royal', 'Sharpless', and 'Taft'.	曾在歷史上真實存在的不同品種 (不一定會在園藝栽種的過程中存留下來) 包括「挑戰」(Challenge)、「狄金森」(Dickinson)、「基斯特」(Kist)、「皇后」(Queen)、「雷伊」 (Rey)、「皇家」(Royal)、「無鋒」(Sharpless) 和「塔夫特」(Taft)。
A stoneless avocado, marketed as a "cocktail avocado," which does not contain a pit, is available on a limited basis.	以「雞尾酒酪梨」之名出現在市面上的無籽酪梨，目前是採限量販售。
They are five to eight centimetres long; the whole fruit may be eaten, including the skin.	長度為五至八公分，可整顆果實連皮一起吃。
It is produced from an unpollinated blossom in which the seed does not develop.	這是由未授粉過的花苞生產而成，種子並未長出來。
Seedless avocados regularly appear on trees.	無籽酪梨經常會出現在樹上。
Known in the avocado industry as "cukes", they are usually discarded commercially due to their small size.	在酪梨產業中有「小胡瓜」之稱，通常會因為個頭太小而遭到捨棄，不會上市販賣。
After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect in 1994, Mexico tried exporting avocados to the US.	在北美自由貿易協定 (NAFTA) 於 1994 年正式生效後，墨西哥曾試圖出口酪梨到美國。
The US government resisted, claiming the trade would introduce Tephritidae fruit flies that would destroy California's crops.	美國政府當時拒絕進口，宣稱該項交易會同時引進果蠅，對加州的農作物造成危害。
The Mexican government responded by inviting USDA inspectors to Mexico, but the US government declined, claiming fruit fly inspection was not feasible.	墨西哥政府做出回應，邀請美國農業部 (USDA) 指派監察員前往墨西哥，但美國政府回絕了這項請求，宣稱這樣的果蠅檢查不切實際。
The Mexican government then proposed to sell avocados only to the northeastern US in the winter (fruit flies cannot withstand extreme cold).	墨西哥政府接著提議僅限在冬季銷售酪梨至美國東北部地區 (果蠅無法熬過極度低溫)。
The US government balked, but gave in when the Mexican government started erecting barriers to US corn.	美國政府悍然拒絕，但是在墨西哥政府開始對美國玉米設置壁壘後，還是讓步了。
Imports from Mexico in the 2005–2006 season exceeded 130,000 metric tons (143,300 short tons; 127,900 long tons).	在 2005 年至 2006 年期間，自墨西哥進口的酪梨量超過了 130,000 公噸 (約 143,300 美噸或 127,900 英噸)。
A computer mouse is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.	電腦滑鼠為盈手可握的指向裝置，可偵測相對於同一平面的二維動態。
This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface.	一般而言，系統會將平面上的動態轉譯成顯示螢幕上的指標動態，讓圖形化使用者介面得以操控流暢。
The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968.	首度公開展示以滑鼠操控電腦系統的活動於 1968 年舉行。
Originally wired to a computer, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.	原本還得透過線路連接電腦，現代則有許多滑鼠可無線操控，靠著短程無線通訊與系統相互連線。
Mice originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, but modern mice often have optical sensors that have no moving parts.	滑鼠原本是透過一顆球體在平面上滾動來偵測動態，不過現代的滑鼠通常都是使用光學感測器，不再含有可動部件。
In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and "wheels", which enable additional control and dimensional input.	除了移動游標之外，電腦滑鼠還會有一個以上的按鈕，可在螢幕上執行如選取選單項目等操作功能。滑鼠通常也會搭配其他元素，好比觸控表面和「滾輪」，以便執行其他操控功能和其他面向的輸入形式。
The earliest known publication of the term mouse as referring to a computer pointing device is in Bill English's July 1965 publication, "Computer-Aided Display Control" likely originating from its resemblance to the shape and size of a mouse, a rodent, with the cord resembling its tail.	目前已知最早公開以滑鼠指稱電腦指向裝置的著作為 Bill English 於 1965 年 7 月發表的「電腦輔助螢幕控制」(Computer-Aided Display Control) 實作報告，靈感可能是源自於它的形狀和大小近似老鼠一般的囓齒動物，再加上有一條像尾巴似的連接線。
The plural for the small rodent is always "mice" in modern usage.	在現代語境中，這種小型囓齒類動物的複數型態都一律稱為「mice」。
The plural of a computer mouse is either "mouses" or "mice" according to most dictionaries, with "mice" being more common.	根據大多數字典的說法，電腦滑鼠的複數型態可以是「mouses」或「mice」，不過有越來越多人使用「mice」。
The first recorded plural usage is "mice"; the online Oxford Dictionaries cites a 1984 use, and earlier uses include J. C. R.	首次有明文記載的複數稱謂則是「mice」。線上版的牛津辭典援引了一筆 1984 年的實際用例，而更早使用的文獻包括了 J. C. R.
Licklider's "The Computer as a Communication Device" of 1968.	Licklider 於 1968 年發表的「淺談電腦通訊裝置」(The Computer as a Commuication Device)。
The term computer mouses may be used informally in some cases.	或許也有人在某些情形下隨意使用「電腦滑鼠」一詞。
Although, the plural of mouse (small rodent) is mice, the two words have undergone a differentiation through usage.	雖然老鼠 (mouse，小型囓齒類動物) 的複數型態為「mice」，但是這兩個字在用法上還是有所分歧。
The trackball, a related pointing device, was invented in 1946 by Ralph Benjamin as part of a post-World War II-era fire-control radar plotting system called Comprehensive Display System (CDS).	軌跡球 (一種與滑鼠相連的指向裝置) 是在 1946 年由 Ralph Benjamin 所發明。當時是戰後名為「全方位顯示系統」(Comprehensive Display System) 的火力管制雷達測繪系統的一部分。
Benjamin was then working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service.	Benjamin 當時任職於英國皇家海軍的科學研究部。
Benjamin's project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick.	Benjamin 的計畫使用了類比電腦來計算目標機接下來的位置。計算根據為使用者透過搖桿輸入的幾組初始定位點。
Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented what they called a "roller ball" for this purpose.	Benjamin 覺得用來輸入資料的裝置需要更講究好看一些，於是為此發明了當時名為「滾輪球」(roller ball) 的裝置。
The device was patented in 1947, but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built, and the device was kept as a military secret.	這項裝置於 1947 年獲得專利，不過當時只有打造出將一顆金屬球架在兩片橡皮輪圈上滾動的初始版本，而且是軍事機密。
Another early trackball was built by Kenyon Taylor, a British electrical engineer working in collaboration with Tom Cranston and Fred Longstaff.	另一款早期的軌跡球是由一位英國的電機工程師 Kenyon Taylor 與 Tom Cranston 和 Fred Longstaff 聯手打造而成。
Taylor was part of the original Ferranti Canada, working on the Royal Canadian Navy's DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving) system in 1952.	Taylor 當時任職於費朗蒂公司 (Ferranti) 的加拿大分部，於 1952 年負責協助加拿大皇家海軍研發 DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving，數位自動化追蹤及解析) 系統。
DATAR was similar in concept to Benjamin's display.	DATAR 在概念上與 Benjamin 展示出來的成品相仿。
The trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions.	該款軌跡球使用四個圓盤來捕捉動態，橫軸及縱軸方向各有兩個。
Several rollers provided mechanical support.	此外還加上幾組滾輪來讓機械運作更為流暢。
When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball.	當球在滾動的時候，負責捕捉動態的圓盤會跟著旋轉，於是圓盤外緣的接觸點會與線路產生週期性接觸，進而產生脈衝輸出並記錄球體的每個動作。
By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined.	透過計算脈衝次數就能判讀球體的實際動向。
A digital computer calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse-code modulation radio signals.	有一台數位電腦會負責計算軌跡，並使用脈衝編碼調製的無線電訊號將計算結果傳送給艦隊中的其他船艦。
This trackball used a standard Canadian five-pin bowling ball.	這款軌跡球使用的是加拿大的標準版五瓶制保齡球。
It was not patented, since it was a secret military project.	因為是軍事機密，所以並未申請專利。
Douglas Engelbart of the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) has been credited in published books by Thierry Bardini, Paul Ceruzzi, Howard Rheingold, and several others as the inventor of the computer mouse.	史丹佛研究所 (即如今的國際史丹佛研究所，SRI International) 的 Douglas Engelbart 在 Thierry Bardini、Paul Ceruzzi、Howard Rheingold 及其他數名學者的出版著作中被稱為電腦滑鼠的發明者。
Engelbart was also recognized as such in various obituary titles after his death in July 2013.	Engelbart 於 2013 年 7 月逝世之後，也曾在各種訃告消息中以發明者之姿受到表揚。
By 1963, Engelbart had already established a research lab at SRI, the Augmentation Research Center (ARC), to pursue his objective of developing both hardware and software computer technology to "augment" human intelligence.	1963 年，Engelbart 此時已經在 SRI 建立了擴展研究中心 (Augmentation Research Center，簡稱 ARC)，藉此追求他同時發展電腦硬體及軟體技術以「擴展」人類智慧的目標。
That November, while attending a conference on computer graphics in Reno, Nevada, Engelbart began to ponder how to adapt the underlying principles of the planimeter to X-Y coordinate input.	那一年的 11 月，Engelbart 在參加於內華達州雷諾市舉行的電腦圖像學研討會時，開始思考著如何讓求積儀的基本原理得以套用在以 X-Y 軸為基礎的座標輸入上。
On November 14, 1963, he first recorded his thoughts in his personal notebook about something he initially called a "bug," which in a "3-point" form could have a "drop point and 2 orthogonal wheels." He wrote that the "bug" would be "easier" and "more natural" to use, and unlike a stylus, it would stay still when let go, which meant it would be "much better for coordination with the keyboard."	1963 年 11 月 14 日，他首先在自己的筆記本中記下了自己的想法。他一開始將其稱為「蟲」，採「3 點接觸」形式，包括「1 個定位落點和 2 個相互垂直的滾輪」。在他的筆下，他認為這個「蟲」使用起來會「更輕鬆」且「更自然」，而且它不同於一般的記錄探針，只要一放開手，它就會靜止不動，這代表它能夠「與鍵盤更加合作無間」。
In 1964, Bill English joined ARC, where he helped Engelbart build the first mouse prototype.	1964 年，Bill English 加入了 ARC，協助 Engelbart 打造出第一個滑鼠原型。
They christened the device the mouse as early models had a cord attached to the rear part of the device which looked like a tail, and in turn resembled the common mouse.	他們將這個裝置命名為「滑鼠」，因為早期的模型會在裝置尾端接上一條線，看起來就像條尾巴，倒轉過來看就如同一般常見的老鼠。
As noted above, this "mouse" was first mentioned in print in a July 1965 report, on which English was the lead author.	如前文所述，「滑鼠」一詞首次出現在於 1965 年 7 月發表的一份報告中，English 為該報告的第一作者。
On 9 December 1968, Engelbart publicly demonstrated the mouse at what would come to be known as The Mother of All Demos.	1968 年 12 月 9 日，Engelbart 公開演示了這款滑鼠的操作方法，後人譽此為「演示活動之母」(The Mother of All Demos)。
Engelbart never received any royalties for it, as his employer SRI held the patent, which expired before the mouse became widely used in personal computers.	因為該款滑鼠的專利權歸屬 SRI 所有，所以 Engelbart 從未以此收到任何一分版稅。待專利過期之後，滑鼠才開始廣泛運用在個人電腦上。
In any event, the invention of the mouse was just a small part of Engelbart's much larger project of augmenting human intellect.	無論如何，發明滑鼠也就只是 Engelbart 擴展人類智慧的雄心壯志中的一小段插曲。
Several other experimental pointing-devices developed for Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS) exploited different body movements – for example, head-mounted devices attached to the chin or nose – but ultimately the mouse won out because of its speed and convenience.	之後也有人參照 Engelbart 的聯線系統 (oN-Line System，簡稱 NLS)，利用不同的身體動作研發出其他實驗性的指向裝置 (例如連結到臉頰或鼻子的頭戴式裝置)，但最後滑鼠還是以其速度和便利性取勝。
The first mouse, a bulky device (pictured) used two potentiometers perpendicular to each other and connected to wheels: the rotation of each wheel translated into motion along one axis.	第一款滑鼠是個相當笨重的裝置 (如圖所示)，使用了兩組相互垂直且接上滾輪的電位計：每個滾輪都會各自沿著一道軸線轉動。
At the time of the "Mother of All Demos", Engelbart's group had been using their second generation, 3-button mouse for about a year.	在進行「演示活動之母」的時候，Engelbart 的團隊已經使用了第二代的三鍵式滑鼠將近一整年了。
On October 2, 1968, a mouse device named Rollkugel (German for "rolling ball") was described as an optional device for its SIG-100 terminal was developed by the German company Telefunken.	據文獻記載，德國的德律風根公司 (Telefunken) 曾於 1968 年 10 月 2 日針對其 SIG-100 終端機研發出名為 Rollkugel (即德文的「滾輪球」) 的滑鼠裝置。
As the name suggests and unlike Engelbart's mouse, the Telefunken model already had a ball.	不同於 Engelbart 的滑鼠，德律風根的滑鼠裝置可謂「鼠如其名」，真的有一顆球在裡面。
It was based on an earlier trackball-like device (also named Rollkugel) that was embedded into radar flight control desks.	這是以嵌在雷達飛行控制台內且形似軌跡球的裝置為基礎 (該裝置也叫做 Rollkugel)。
This trackball had been developed by a team led by Rainer Mallebrein at Telefunken Konstanz for the German Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung (Federal Air Traffic Control) as part of their TR 86 process computer system with its SIG 100-86 vector graphics terminal.	這款軌跡球是在 Rainer Mallebrein 的率領下，由德律風根公司康士坦茲分部的團隊為德國聯邦航管局 (Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung) 研發出來的裝置，為其 TR 86 電腦處理系統和 SIG 100-86 向量式圖像終端機的一部分。
When the development for the Telefunken main frame TR 440 began in 1965, Mallebrein and his team came up with the idea of "reversing" the existing Rollkugel into a moveable mouse-like device, so that customers did not have to be bothered with mounting holes for the earlier trackball device.	當德律風根公司於 1965 年開始研發其 TR 440 主機時，Mallebrein 和他的團隊靈機一動，將現有的 Rollkugel「反轉過來」變成如老鼠般的可動式裝置，讓客戶不用再為早期軌跡球裝置上的諸多安裝孔感到煩躁。
Together with light pens and trackballs, it was offered as an optional input device for their system since 1968.	在結合了光筆和軌跡球之後，從 1968 年開始成為他們的系統輸入選用裝置。
Some Rollkugel mouses installed at the Leibniz-Rechenzentrum in Munich in 1972 are well preserved in a museum.	有些滑鼠於 1972 年安裝在慕尼黑的萊布尼茲超級計算中心 (Leibniz-Rechenzentrum) 內，至今仍完好保存在博物館中。
Telefunken considered the invention too unimportant to apply for a patent on it.	不過德律風根公司認為這項發明還沒重要到值得為此申請專利。
The Xerox Alto was one of the first computers designed for individual use in 1973 and is regarded as the first modern computer to utilize a mouse.	於 1973 年問世的 Xerox Alto 是最早開始專為個人使用所設計的其中一款電腦，也被認為是第一款運用滑鼠操控的現代化電腦。
Inspired by PARC's Alto, the Lilith, a computer which had been developed by a team around Niklaus Wirth at ETH Zürich between 1978 and 1980, provided a mouse as well.	在帕羅奧多研究中心 (PARC) 推出的 Alto 電腦啟發之下，由蘇黎世聯邦理工學院 (ETH Zürich) 的 Niklaus Wirth 團隊於 1978 年至 1980 年間研發出的 Lilith 電腦也提供了滑鼠裝置。
The third marketed version of an integrated mouse shipped as a part of a computer and intended for personal computer navigation came with the Xerox 8010 Star in 1981.	第三個整合了滑鼠裝置與電腦系統，且做為個人電腦上市販售的是於 1981 年問世的 Xerox 8010 Star。
By 1982, the Xerox 8010 was probably the best-known computer with a mouse.	到了 1982 年，Xerox 8010 可說是當時最知名的有滑鼠的電腦。
The Sun-1 also came with a mouse, and the forthcoming Apple Lisa was rumored to use one, but the peripheral remained obscure; Jack Hawley of The Mouse House reported that one buyer for a large organization believed at first that his company sold lab mice.	後來的 Sun-1 電腦也附有滑鼠，當時也曾一度謠傳說即將推出的蘋果 Lisa 電腦有使用滑鼠，但結果其周邊裝置還是鮮為人知。經營「滑鼠之家」(The Mouse House) 的 Jack Hawley 曾在報導中表示，有一位來自大公司的買家一開始還認為他在販賣實驗小鼠。
Hawley, who manufactured mice for Xerox, stated that "Practically, I have the market all to myself right now"; a Hawley mouse cost $415.	Hawley 負責為全錄公司製造滑鼠，曾宣稱「我幾乎可說是獨霸當今的滑鼠市場」。當年 Hawley 滑鼠的單價為 415 美元。
In 1982, Logitech introduced the P4 Mouse at the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas, its first hardware mouse.	1982 年，羅技公司 (Logitech) 在拉斯維加斯的 Comdex 貿易展上正式推出 P4 滑鼠，為旗下第一款硬體滑鼠。
That same year Microsoft made the decision to make the MS-DOS program Microsoft Word mouse-compatible, and developed the first PC-compatible mouse.	同年，微軟公司 (Microsoft) 決定讓 MS-DOS 系統的 Microsoft Word 程式能夠與滑鼠相容，並研發出第一款能與個人電腦相容的滑鼠。
Microsoft's mouse shipped in 1983, thus beginning the Microsoft Hardware division of the company.	微軟的滑鼠於 1983 正式出貨銷售，其硬體部門也就此開始正式營運。
However, the mouse remained relatively obscure until the appearance of the Macintosh 128K (which included an updated version of the Lisa Mouse) in 1984, and of the Amiga 1000 and the Atari ST in 1985.	然而，此時的滑鼠依然未受到重視，直到 Macintosh 128K 型電腦 (內含更新版的 Lisa 滑鼠) 以及 Amiga 1000 型和 Atari ST 型電腦分別於 1984 年和 1985 年出現，才開始受人注目。
Other uses of the mouse's input occur commonly in special application-domains.	滑鼠的輸入功能也時常在特殊的應用領域中出現其他用途。
In interactive three-dimensional graphics, the mouse's motion often translates directly into changes in the virtual objects' or camera's orientation.	在互動式 3D 圖像中，系統通常會將滑鼠的動作直接轉譯為虛擬物件或鏡頭的方向變動。
For example, in the first-person shooter genre of games (see below), players usually employ the mouse to control the direction in which the virtual player's "head" faces: moving the mouse up will cause the player to look up, revealing the view above the player's head.	例如，在使用第一人稱視角的射擊遊戲中 (請見下圖)，玩家通常會運用滑鼠來控制虛擬玩家角色的「頭」要往哪邊看：滑鼠往上移，玩家就會往上看，螢幕上則會出現玩家頭上的景象。
A related function makes an image of an object rotate, so that all sides can be examined.	相關功能也能讓物件圖像旋轉，進而檢視每一個面向。
3D design and animation software often modally chords many different combinations to allow objects and cameras to be rotated and moved through space with the few axes of movement mice can detect.	3D 設計和動畫軟體經常會透過程式協調許多不同的動向組合，讓物件和鏡頭得以藉由幾個滑鼠能夠偵測到的軸向運動來進行旋轉，或是在空間中移動。
When mice have more than one button, the software may assign different functions to each button.	若所使用的滑鼠有一個以上的按鍵，則軟體可以分配不同的功能給每一個按鍵。
Often, the primary (leftmost in a right-handed configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (rightmost in a right-handed) button will bring up a menu of alternative actions applicable to that item.	通常來說，滑鼠的主要按鍵 (大多是以右撇子為配置的滑鼠左鍵) 是用來選取項目，次要按鍵 (大多是右撇子配置的滑鼠右鍵) 則是用來開啟可套用在該項目上的其他動作選單。
For example, on platforms with more than one button, the Mozilla web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new tab or window in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.	例如，若使用具有一個以上按鍵的滑鼠平台，Mozilla 網頁瀏覽器會在使用者點擊主要按鍵之後追蹤到所選取的連結，接著在點擊次要按鍵後跳出快捷選單，選單上有適用於該連結的各項動作。點擊第三 (中央) 滑鼠按鍵則通常會讓瀏覽器另開新分頁或新視窗。
Optical mice rely entirely on one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and an imaging array of photodiodes to detect movement relative to the underlying surface, eschewing the internal moving parts a mechanical mouse uses in addition to its optics.	光學滑鼠全靠一組或多組發光二極體 (LED) 以及能感測影像的光電二極體陣列來偵測相對於滑鼠墊面的動作方向，不再使用機械滑鼠的內建可動部件。
A laser mouse is an optical mouse that uses coherent (laser) light.	雷射滑鼠為使用同調 (雷射) 光的光學滑鼠。
The earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces, whereas the modern LED optical mouse works on most opaque diffuse surfaces; it is usually unable to detect movement on specular surfaces like polished stone.	最早出現的光學滑鼠得在預先印製好的滑鼠墊面上偵測動作，現代的 LED 光學滑鼠則能夠大多數不透明的漫反射表面上操作。這類滑鼠通常無法在像拋光岩面般的鏡射表面上偵測動作。
Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision, improving performance on opaque specular surfaces.	雷射二極體也會用來增進解析度和精準度，改善在不透明的鏡射表面上的效能表現。
Battery powered, wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.	使用電池的無線光學滑鼠會為了節省電力讓 LED 光源不停閃爍，只有在偵測到動作時才會穩定發亮。
Often called "air mice" since they do not require a surface to operate, inertial mice use a tuning fork or other accelerometer (US Patent 4787051) to detect rotary movement for every axis supported.	體感滑鼠 (inertial mouse) 因為不需在平面上操作，通常會被稱作是「空中飛鼠」。這類滑鼠會使用類似音叉的裝置或是其他加速度感測器 (美國專利序號 4787051) 來偵測所有支援軸線上的旋轉動作。
The most common models (manufactured by Logitech and Gyration) work using 2 degrees of rotational freedom and are insensitive to spatial translation.	最常見的款式 (由羅技公司和 Gyration 公司生產製造) 具有兩個面向的旋轉自由度，並且不會受空間平移所影響。
The user requires only small wrist rotations to move the cursor, reducing user fatigue or "gorilla arm".	使用者只要稍微轉一下手腕就能移動游標，減輕其疲勞感或避免出現「猩猩臂膀」(gorilla arm)。
Usually cordless, they often have a switch to deactivate the movement circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position.	體感滑鼠通常為無線操作，並設有可在使用過程中關閉動作偵測的開關，讓使用者可以自由擺動而不用擔心會影響到游標定位。
A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased ease-of-use.	有一份體感滑鼠的專利聲明中提到該款滑鼠所消耗的電力比光學滑鼠還要少，而且具有更高的靈敏度、重量更輕，使用起來更方便。
In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture.	結合了無線鍵盤的體感滑鼠能夠提供不同以往的人體工學配置，不再需要平滑的工作表面，並可望減輕某些因工作姿勢不良而經年累月產生的傷害。
Also known as bats, flying mice, or wands, these devices generally function through ultrasound and provide at least three degrees of freedom.	也有人稱呼這類裝置為「蝙蝠」、「空中飛鼠」或「魔杖」，一般均可透過超音波進行功能操作，並提供至少三種面向的自由度。
Probably the best known example would be 3Dconnexion ("Logitech's SpaceMouse") from the early 1990s.	最廣為人知的例子大概會是從 1990 年代早期推出的一系列 3Dconnexion 裝置 (如「羅技公司的太空滑鼠」)。
In the late 1990s Kantek introduced the 3D RingMouse.	Kantek 公司於 1990 年代末推出了 3D 戒指滑鼠。
This wireless mouse was worn on a ring around a finger, which enabled the thumb to access three buttons.	這款無線滑鼠為可戴在手指上的指環裝置，能夠以拇指點擊上面的三個按鍵。
The mouse was tracked in three dimensions by a base station.	滑鼠的基站會追蹤滑鼠在三維空間中的移動軌跡。
Despite a certain appeal, it was finally discontinued because it did not provide sufficient resolution.	儘管頗具吸引力，但最後還是因為無法提供充足的解決方案而黯然退場。
One example of a 2000s consumer 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote.	2000 年後其中一個進入消費市場的 3D 指向裝置範例，就是 Wii 遙控手把 (Wii Remote)。
While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation).	Wii 遙控手把的主要用途為動態感測裝置 (也就是說，它能夠判讀自身的方位和移動方向)，也能透過使用內建的紅外線鏡頭來比較紅外線發射器的光線位置和距離，偵測出自身的空間定位 (因為 Nunchuk 控制器配件並未裝設鏡頭，所以僅能得知自身目前的方向和方位)。
The obvious drawback to this approach is that it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar.	這款產品最大的缺點在於它只有在自身鏡頭可以看見條狀感測器時，才能判讀出空間座標。
More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system.	後來消費市場中出現了定位更精準的裝置，包括 PlayStation Move 動態控制器、Razer Hydra 體感控制器，以及 HTC Vive 虛擬實境系統的專屬控制手把。
All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.	這些裝置都能在三維空間中精準偵測出自身定位及方向，無論自身與感測站之間的相對角度有多大。
A mouse-related controller called the SpaceBall has a ball placed above the work surface that can easily be gripped.	有個與滑鼠相關的控制器名為 SpaceBall，在工作表面上方設置了一顆能夠輕鬆讓人抓握的球體。
With spring-loaded centering, it sends both translational as well as angular displacements on all six axes, in both directions for each.	球體內部裝了彈簧，能夠傳送球體平移以及一共六個方向軸的角度移位動態資訊，每個方向都一視同仁。
In November 2010 a German Company called Axsotic introduced a new concept of 3D mouse called 3D Spheric Mouse.	2010 年 11 月，一間名為 Axsotic 的德國公司推出了新款 3D 概念滑鼠，取名為 3D 球形滑鼠。
This new concept of a true six degree-of-freedom input device uses a ball to rotate in 3 axes without any limitations.	這款全新的概念滑鼠為真正具有六面向自由度的輸入裝置，使用了一顆能夠無拘無束進行三軸滾動的球體。
In 2000, Logitech introduced a "tactile mouse" that contained a small actuator to make the mouse vibrate.	2000 年，羅技公司推出「觸覺滑鼠」，內含一組能讓滑鼠震動的小型致動器。
Such a mouse can augment user-interfaces with haptic feedback, such as giving feedback when crossing a window boundary.	這款滑鼠能透過觸覺回饋增強使用者介面體驗，比如在跨越窗框邊界時給予相應的回饋感受。
To surf by touch requires the user to be able to feel depth or hardness; this ability was realized with the first electrorheological tactile mice but never marketed.	若要透過觸碰來感受衝浪，使用者必須能夠感受到海浪的深度或強度。第一款電流變觸覺滑鼠曾經實現了這項功能，卻從未在市場上販售。
Tablet digitizers are sometimes used with accessories called pucks, devices which rely on absolute positioning, but can be configured for sufficiently mouse-like relative tracking that they are sometimes marketed as mice.	平板電腦數位轉換器有時會和名為「定位盤」(puck) 的配件一起使用。這是需要絕對定位的裝置，但也可以配置幾乎跟滑鼠一模一樣的相對追蹤定位功能，有時會當成滑鼠在市面上販售。
As the name suggests, this type of mouse is intended to provide optimum comfort and avoid injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis and other repetitive strain injuries.	鼠如其名，這一類滑鼠致力於提供最佳的體感舒適度，以及避免發生腕隧道症候群 (carpal tunnel syndrome)、關節炎 (arthritis) 和因為反覆拉扯而造成的傷害。
It is designed to fit natural hand position and movements, to reduce discomfort.	其設計以符合自然的手部姿態和動作為要點，藉此減輕不適感。
