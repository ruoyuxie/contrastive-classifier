There were varying degrees of Romanization throughout Roman Dacia.	整个罗马达契亚有不同程度的罗马化。
The most Romanized segment was the region along the Danube, which was predominately under imperial administration, albeit in a form that was partially barbarized.	罗马化程度最高的部分是多瑙河沿岸地区，该地区主要由帝国管理，不过其形式为部分野蛮化。
The population beyond this zone, having lived with the Roman legions before their withdrawal, were substantially Romanized.	在罗马军团撤退前，该地区以外的人口与他们生活在一起，基本上已经罗马化。
The final zone, consisting of the northern portions of Maramures, Crisana, and Moldavia, stood at the edges of Roman Dacia.	最后一个区域由马拉穆列什、克里萨拉和摩尔达维亚组成，位于罗马达契亚的边缘。
Although its people did not have Roman legions stationed among them, they were still nominally under the control of Rome, politically, socially, and economically.	虽然罗马军团没有驻扎其中，但人们在政治、社会和经济方面仍然名义上处于罗马的控制之下。
These were the areas in which resided the Carpi, often referred to as the Free Dacians.	这些地区居住着卡尔皮人，通常被称为自由达契亚人。
In an attempt to fill the cities, cultivate the fields, and mine the ore, a large-scale attempt at colonization took place with colonists coming in "from all over the Roman world".	为了充盈城市、耕种田地和开采矿石，进行了大规模的殖民化尝试，殖民者“从罗马世界的各个角落”涌入。
The colonists were a heterogeneous mix: of the some 3,000 names preserved in inscriptions found by the 1990s, 74% (c. 2,200) were Latin, 14% (c. 420) were Greek, 4% (c. 120) were Illyrian, 2.3% (c. 70) were Celtic, 2% (c. 60) were Thraco-Dacian, and another 2% (c. 60) were Semites from Syria.	殖民者鱼龙混杂：在 20 世纪 90 年代发现的大约 3,000 个保存在铭文中的名字中，74%（约 2,200 人）是拉丁人，14%（约 420 人）是希腊人，4%（约 120 人）是伊利安人，2.3%（约 70 人）是凯尔特人，2%（约 60 人）是色拉科-达契亚人，另外 2%（约 60 人）是来自叙利亚的闪米特人。
Regardless of their place of origin, the settlers and colonists were a physical manifestation of Roman civilisation and imperial culture, bringing with them the most effective Romanizing mechanism: the use of Latin as the new lingua franca.	无论他们来自哪里，定居者和殖民者都是罗马文明和帝国文化的实际体现，他们带来了最有效的罗马化机制：使用拉丁语作为新的通用语。
The first settlement at Sarmizegethusa was made up of Roman citizens who had retired from the legions.	Sarmizegethusa 的第一个村落由从军团退役的罗马公民组成。
Based upon the location of names scattered throughout the province, it has been argued that, although places of origin are hardly ever noted in epigraphs, a large percentage of colonists originated from Noricum and western Pannonia.	根据散落该省各地的名称的位置来看，有人认为，尽管铭文中几乎没有注明原籍地，但很大一部分殖民者来自诺里库姆和潘诺尼亚西部。
Specialist miners (the Pirusti tribesmen) were brought in from Dalmatia.	专业矿工（佩拉斯特部落成员）是从达尔马提亚带来的。
These Dalmatian miners were kept in sheltered communities (Vicus Pirustarum) and were under the jurisdiction of their own tribal leadership (with individual leaders referred to as princeps).	这些达尔马提亚矿工被生活在群落庇护所 (Vicus Pirustarum) 并由他们自己的部落领导（称为第一公民的个人领袖）进行管辖。
An estimated 50,000 troops were stationed in Dacia at its height.	在达契亚的鼎盛时期，估计有 50,000 名士兵驻扎在达契亚。
At the close of Trajan's first campaign in Dacia in 102, he stationed one legion at Sarmizegetusa Regia.	102 年，在达契亚的第一次战役结束后，图拉真在 Sarmizegetusa Regia 驻扎了一个军团。
With the conclusion of Trajan's conquest of Dacia, he stationed at least two legions in the new province – the Legio IV Flavia Felix positioned at Berzobis, and the Legio XIII Gemina stationed at Apulum.	随着图拉真对达契亚的征服结束，他在这个新行省至少驻扎了两个军团 - 驻扎在 Berzobis 的 Flavia Felix 第四军团和驻扎在 Apulum 的 Gemina 第十三军团。
It has been conjectured that there was a third legion stationed in Dacia at the same time, the Legio I Adiutrix.	据推测，同一时期还有第三个军团驻扎在达契亚，那就是 Adiutrix 第一军团。
However, there is no evidence to indicate when or where it was stationed, and it is unclear whether the legion was fully present, or whether it was only the vexillationes who were stationed in the province.	不过，没有证据表明它于何时何地驻扎，也不清楚该军团是否全员出动，或者是否只有分队驻扎在该省。
Hadrian, the subsequent emperor, shifted the fourth legion (Legio IV Flavia Felix) from Berzobis to Singidunum in Moesia Superior, suggesting that Hadrian believed the presence of one legion in Dacia would be sufficient to ensure the security of the province.	后来的皇帝哈德良将第四军团（Flavia Felix 第四军团）从 Berzobis 转移到 Moesia Superior 的 Singidunum，表明了哈德良认为在达契亚派驻一个军团就足以确保该省的安全。
The Marcomannic Wars that erupted north of the Danube forced Marcus Aurelius to reverse this policy, permanently transferring the Legio V Macedonica from Troesmis (modern Iglița in Romania) in Moesia Inferior to Potaissa in Dacia.	多瑙河以北爆发的马克曼尼战争迫使马库斯奥雷留斯改变了这一策略，将马其顿第五军团从 Moesia Inferior 的 Troesmis（现今的罗马尼亚 lglita）永久转移到达契亚的 Potaissa。
The Kingston Fossil Plant is located on a peninsula at the junction of the Emory River (to the north) and Clinch River (to the south and east), just over 4 miles (6.4 km) upstream from the latter's mouth along the Tennessee River.	Kingston 化石发电厂位于埃默里河（北部）与克林奇河（南部和东部）交界处的一个半岛上，距离后者沿田纳西河的河口仅 4 英里（6.4 公里）。
Watts Bar Dam, located along the Tennessee 38 miles (61 km) downstream from the mouth of the Clinch, impounds a reservoir (Watts Bar Lake) that spans a 72-mile (116 km) stretch of the Tennessee (to Fort Loudoun Dam), the lower 23 miles (37 km) of the Clinch (to Melton Hill Dam), and the lower 12 miles (19 km) of the Emory.	Watts Bar 大坝位于克林奇河口下游 38 英里（61 公里）的田纳西河沿岸，蓄积的水库（Watts Bar 湖）横跨田纳西 72 英里（116 公里）（到 Fort Loudoun 大坝）、克林奇下游 23 英里（37 公里）（到 Melton Hill 大坝），以及埃默里下游 12 英里（19 公里）。
The plant, originally known as the Kingston Steam Plant, began operations in 1954, primarily to provide electricity to atomic energy installations at nearby Oak Ridge.	该工厂原名为 Kingston 蒸汽厂，于 1954 年开始运营，主要为附近 Oak Ridge 的原子能装置供电。
The plant contains nine units with a combined generating capacity of 1,398 megawatts, and burns about 14,000 tonnes (14,000,000 kg) of coal every day.	该厂有 9 台机组，总发电量为 1,398 兆瓦，每天燃烧约 14,000 吨（14,000,000 公斤）煤。
The plant's ash pond disposal area is located immediately north of the plant along the Emory River shore.	该厂的灰场处理区位于工厂北边的埃默里河岸边。
The ash pond, which was impounded by a dike that rose 60 feet (18 m) above the winter level and 741 feet (226 m) above sea level, contained a watery slurry of fly ash generated by the burning of finely ground coal at the power plant.	灰场由比冬季水位 60 英尺（18 米）高和海平面以上 741 英尺（226 米）的堤坝蓄水，里面有发电厂燃烧细碎煤炭所产生的水状飞灰浆。
Fly ash is the fine particulate pollutants produced by the combustion of coal, which are collected rather than allowing them to escape into the atmosphere, then mixed with water and pumped into a retaining pond, where the ash gradually settles to the bottom.	飞灰是煤炭燃烧产生的细粒污染物，它们会被收集起来，不会让它们逃逸到大气中，然后与水混合并泵入蓄水池，在那里煤灰逐渐沉淀到底部。
Once the particulate matter settles out, it is dredged and moved to drying cells.	颗粒物质沉淀后，就会被挖出并移至干燥室。
The 84-acre (0.34 km²) unlined above-ground dredge cell was surrounded by 60-foot (18 m) tall earthen dikes.	占地 84 英亩（0.34 平方公里）的无衬里地上疏浚室由 60 英尺（18 米）高的土堤包围。
The dike breach occurred at the northwest corner of the dewatering pond, overlooking the Swan Pond Creek spillway.	堤坝决口发生在脱水池的西北角，俯瞰 Swan Pond Creek 的泄洪道。
TVA had reportedly known about the dangers of using wet storage ponds for coal ash since a 1969 spill in Virginia in which coal ash seeped into the Clinch River and killed countless fish.	据报道，自从 1969 年弗吉尼亚州发生煤灰泄露事件，煤灰渗入克林奇河并导致无数鱼类死亡后，TVA 就知道了使用湿式储存池处理煤灰的危险性。
In the 1980s, TVA engineers raised concerns about the stability of ash ponds.	在 20 世纪 80 年代，TVA 的工程师提出了对灰池稳定性的担忧。
The utility repeatedly found leaks in levees and seepage in the soil at many of their ash ponds, including the ones at Kingston.	该电厂多次发现他们许多灰场的堤坝泄露并渗入土壤，其中就包括 Kingston 的灰场。
However, TVA continued to make small repairs instead of switch to dry storage systems which would have cost ratepayers tens of millions.	然而，TVA 继续进行小规模维修，而不是改用原本会耗费纳税人数千万美元的干式储存系统。
At the time of the disaster, TVA was using wet storage at six of their 11 coal-fired power plants.	在灾难发生时，TVA 旗下 11 家煤电厂中有 6 家在使用湿式储存。
Leaks at the Kingston ash ponds had reportedly been taking place since the early 1980s, and local residents said that the spill was not a unique occurrence.	据报道，自 20 世纪 80 年代初以来，Kingston 灰场一直在发生泄露，当地居民称，这次泄露并非特例。
The 1960s-era pond had been observed leaking and being repaired nearly every year since 2001.	自 2001 年以来，这个上世纪 60 年代的灰场几乎每年都发生泄露和修理。
The two worst leaks occurred in 2003 and 2006 in which TVA suspended all ash deposits in the ponds to allow the dredge cells to dry out and stabilize.	两次最严重的泄露发生在 2003 年和 2006 年，当时 TVA 暂停了灰场中的所有煤灰沉积以使疏浚室干燥并稳定下来。
An October 2008 inspection report had identified a "minor leak" in the faulty wall, but the report was not finalized.	2008 年 10 月的一份检查报告中认定故障墙体有“轻微泄露”，但并未最终敲定该报告。
The spill began sometime between midnight and 1 a.m.	泄露开始于午夜和凌晨 1 点之间的某个时间。
In January 1973 Young was made Chief of the Space Shuttle Branch of the Astronaut Office.	1973 年 1 月，Young 被任命为宇航员办公室航天飞机处处长。
In January 1974, he became Chief of the Astronaut Office after the retirement of Alan Shepard.	1974 年 1 月，在 Alan Shepard 退休后，他成为宇航员办公室主任。
Young flew two missions of the Space Shuttle, both aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia.	Young 执行了两次航天飞机的飞行任务，两次任务都在哥伦比亚号航天飞机上进行。
He commanded the program's 1981 maiden orbital flight, STS-1, and in 1983 commanded STS-9, which carried the first Spacelab module.	他指挥了该计划在 1981 年的首次轨道飞行 STS-1，并在 1983 年指挥 搭载了第一个太空实验室模块的 STS-9。
In 1986 he was in line to make a record seventh space flight on STS-61-J to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, but the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster earlier that year had delayed NASA's schedule.	1986 年，他准备在 STS-61-J 上进行创纪录的第七次太空飞行，部署哈勃太空望远镜，但该年早些时候的挑战者号航天飞机灾难推迟了美国航空航天局的计划。
Young was openly critical of NASA management following the Challenger disaster, and in April 1987 was made Special Assistant to JSC Director Aaron Cohen for Engineering, Operations and Safety.	在挑战者号航天飞机灾难发生后，Young 公开批评美国航空航天局管理层，并于 1987 年 4 月被任命为 JSC 主任 Aaron Cohen 的工程、运营和安全特别助理。
NASA denied that his criticism triggered the move, although Young and industry insiders believed that was the reason for the reassignment.	尽管美国航空航天局否认他的批评引发了这一举动，不过 Young 和业内人士认为这是他被调任的原因。
In February 1996, he was assigned as Associate Director (Technical) JSC.	1996 年 2 月，他被任命为 JSC 副主任（技术）。
During his NASA career, Young logged more than 15,000 hours of training, mostly in simulators, to prepare for positions on eleven spaceflights in prime and backup crew positions.	Young 在美国航空航天局的职业生涯中，进行了超过 15,000 小时的训练，大部分在模拟器中进行，为 11 次太空飞行的主要和后备乘员位置做准备。
Young worked for NASA for 42 years and announced his retirement on December 7, 2004.	Young 为美国航空航天局工作了 42 年，于 2004 年 12 月 7 日宣布退休。
He retired on December 31, 2004, at the age of 74, but continued to attend the Monday Morning Meeting at the Astronaut Office at JSC for several years thereafter.	他于 2004 年 12 月 31 日退休，时年 74 岁，但此后数年继续参加在 JSC 宇航员办公室举行的周一早会。
He logged more than 15,275 hours flying time in props, jets, helicopters, and rocket jets; more than 9,200 hours in T-38s; and 835 hours in spacecraft during six space flights.	他在道具、喷气机、直升机和火箭喷气机上的飞行时间超过 15,275 小时；在 T-38 飞机上的飞行时间超过 9,200 小时；六次太空飞行中在航天器上飞行了 835 小时。
On April 12, 2006, Young appeared at the 25th anniversary of the STS-1 launch at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, along with pilot Robert Crippen.	2006 年 4 月 12 日，Young 亮相肯尼迪航天中心参观园区的 STS-1 发射 25 周年纪念会，一同出现的还有飞行员 Robert Crippen。
The two spoke of their experiences during the flight.	两人谈到了他们在飞行中的经历。
In 2012, Young published an autobiography, Forever Young.	2012 年，Young 出版了一本自传《永远的 Young》。

He was 87.	享年 87 岁。
Abbotsford Bridge is a steel Allan truss bridge that is about 240 m (790 ft) in length.	Abbotsford 大桥是一座钢制艾伦桁架桥，全长约 240 米（790 英尺）。
The bridge also contains a single lift span about 20 m (66 ft) in length, which is still in working order.	该桥还有一个长约 20 米（66 英尺）的升降式桥孔，该桥孔仍处于工作状态。
It is two lanes wide through most of its length, but the lift span is only capable of carrying a single lane.	它的大部分长度为双车道，但升降式桥孔只能承载单车道。
The entire bridge has been marked with a single lane and has traffic lights on both ends to control vehicular flow.	整座桥被标为单车道，两端都有交通灯来控制车流量。
The bridge was completed in 1928 by the NSW Department of Public Works and, although opened as a traffic bridge, it was designed to carry the loads required for a railway, once the Mildura railway line had been extended over the bridge.	该桥于 1928 年由新南威尔士州公共工程部完成，虽然是作为交通桥开放，但在 Mildura 铁路线延伸过这座桥后，它被设计为承载铁路所需的负荷。
The line was never extended beyond Yelta, where the terminus remains to this day.	这条线路从未延伸到 Yelta 之外，那里的终点站至今仍在。
The location of the bridge was thought to be convenient, as it provided a link to the Sturt Highway without travelling farther upstream to Mildura.	这座桥的位置便利，因为它提供了连接 Sturt 公路的通道，不用再往上游的 Mildura 行进。
It is the only remaining steel truss bridge with a lift span on the Murray, although other lifting bridges still exist along the river.	这是 Murray 河上仅存的一座有升降式桥孔的钢桁架桥，不过沿河仍有其它升降桥。
The bridge was built after the decline in commercial river traffic on the Murray.	这座桥是在 Murray 河的商业河道交通衰退后建造的。
Due to its significance to the local area, it has been listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.	鉴于它对当地的重要性，它已被载入新南威尔士州遗产名录。
The nearby town of Wentworth was an important river port from which wool was shipped to the coast, and as such there was a variety of traffic in the area.	附近的 Wentworth 镇是一个重要的河港，羊毛从这里运往海岸，因此该地区交通便利。
In the 1890s, irrigated farming greatly expanded in Sunraysia region which is known for its fruit production, and traffic volumes increased further.	19 世纪 90 年代，以水果生产闻名的 Sunraysia 地区的灌溉农业大大扩张，交通量进一步增加。
It was decided to install a punt at this location (then known as Abbot's Ford).	人们决定在这个地方（当时称为 Abbot's Ford）安装一个船坞。
New South Wales and Victoria had signed an agreement towards constructing bridges for railways over the Murray to serve the settlements on the northern side.	新南威尔士州和维多利亚州签署了一项协议，将为 Murray 河上的铁路建造桥梁，来服务北侧的村落。
In 1923, a report was released that recommended going ahead with the building of four bridges, one of those being the future Abbotsford Bridge.	1923 年，在发布的一份报告中，建议继续建造四座桥梁，其中一座就是后来的 Abbotsford 大桥。
It was said a bridge in this area would benefit Curlwaa, Wentworth, and a proposed irrigation scheme to the north.	据称，在这个地区建桥将有利于 Curlwaa、Wentworth 和一项拟议的北部灌溉计划。
The cost was estimated at £78,000.	费用估计为 78,000 英镑。
It had been considered that it might be appropriate to combine these four bridges with locks, but this idea was rejected due to siting concerns.	有人认为也许可以将这四座桥与水闸结合起来，但由于选址问题，这个想法被拒绝。
In 1924, residents of nearby settlements urged construction of the railway line to the proposed bridge site, but they were told this extension of the line was to be delayed.	1924 年，附近村落的居民敦促将铁路线修建到拟议的桥址，但他们被告知铁路线延伸将被推迟。
Within that year it was decided that a bridge was to be constructed due to increased traffic volume, and tenders were let for manufacture of the bridge spans, construction of abutments and piles, and transport of materials to the future construction site.	同年，由于交通量增加，决定建造一座桥，并对桥孔的制造、桥墩和桩基的建造以及对日后工地的材料运输进行了招标。
Achebe expanded this criticism when he presented a Chancellor's Lecture at Amherst on 18 February 1975, 'An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's "Heart of Darkness"'.	1975 年 2 月 18 日，Achebe 在阿莫斯特发表了题为“非洲的形象 - 康拉德《黑暗之心》中的种族主义”的校长讲座，扩大了这种批评。
Decrying Joseph Conrad as "a bloody racist", Achebe asserted that Conrad's famous novel dehumanises Africans, rendering Africa as "a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognisable humanity, into which the wandering European enters at his peril."	Achebe 谴责约瑟夫康拉德是“血腥的种族主义者”，断言康拉德的名著将非洲人非人化，将非洲描绘为“一个没有任何可承认的人性的形而上的战场，彷徨的欧洲人进入这个战场会有危险”。
Achebe also discussed a quotation from Albert Schweitzer, a 1952 Nobel Peace Prize laureate: "That extraordinary missionary, Albert Schweitzer, who sacrificed brilliant careers in music and theology in Europe for a life of service to Africans in much the same area as Conrad writes about, epitomizes the ambivalence.	Achebe 还讨论了 1952 年诺贝尔和平奖得主 Albert Schweitzer 的一段话：“那个非凡的传教士 Albert Schweitzer 牺牲了在欧洲的音乐和神学造诣，在康拉德笔下的同一地区为非洲人服务，他是这种矛盾心里的缩影。”
In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: 'The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother.' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being." Some were surprised that Achebe would challenge a man honoured in the West for his "reverence for life".	在一段经常被引用的评论中，Schweitzer 说道：“非洲人确实是我的兄弟，但却是我的小弟。”于是他着手建造一所适合小弟需求的医院，其卫生标准不免让人想起病原菌学说出现前的医疗实践。”一些人对 Achebe 质疑一个在西方因“敬畏生命”而受到尊敬的人而感到吃惊。
The lecture caused a storm of controversy, even at the reception immediately following his talk.	这次演讲引起了一场争议风暴，甚至在他演讲之后的招待会上也是如此。
Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks; one elderly professor reportedly approached him, said: "How dare you!", and stormed away.	许多与会的英语教授对他的言论感到不满；据报道，一位年长的教授走到他面前，说：“你怎么敢！”，然后冲了出去。
Another suggested that Achebe had "no sense of humour", but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor, who told him: "I now realize that I had never really read Heart of Darkness although I have taught it for years." Although the lecture angered many of his colleagues, he was nevertheless presented later in 1975 with an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling and the Lotus Prize for Afro-Asian Writers.	另一位教授认为 Achebe“没有幽默感”，但几天后，第三位教授找到了 Achebe，告诉他：“我现在意识到，尽管我已经教了《黑暗之心》很多年，但我从来没有真正读懂过它。”虽然这次演讲激怒了他的许多同事，但他还是在 1975 年被授予斯特林大学荣誉博士学位和亚非拉作家莲花奖。
The first comprehensive rebuttal of Achebe's critique was published in 1983 by British critic Cedric Watts.	1983 年，英国批评家 Cedric Watts 发表了对 Achebe 的批判的第一次全面反驳。
His essay "A Bloody Racist: About Achebe's View of Conrad" defends Heart of Darkness as an anti-imperialist novel, suggesting that "part of its greatness lies in the power of its criticisms of racial prejudice." Palestinian–American theorist Edward Said agreed in his book Culture and Imperialism that Conrad criticised imperialism, but added: "As a creature of his time, Conrad could not grant the natives their freedom, despite his severe critique of the imperialism that enslaved them".	他的文章“血腥的种族主义者：关于 Achebe 对康拉德的看法”为《黑暗之心》辩护，认为它是一部反帝国主义的小说，暗示“它的伟大之处在于它对种族偏见的批评的力量。”巴勒斯坦裔美国理论家 Edward Said 在他的《文化与帝国主义》一书中同意康拉德批判了帝国主义，但他补充道：“作为他那个时代的产物，康拉德不能给予当地人自由，尽管他对奴役他们的帝国主义进行了严厉的批判。”
Building on Watts and Said, Nidesh Lawtoo argued that "underneath the first layer of straightforward opposition ... we find an underlying mimetic continuity between Conrad's colonial image of Africa [in Heart of Darkness] and Achebe's postcolonial representation" in Things Fall Apart.	在 Watts 和 Said 的基础上，Nidesh Lawtoo 认为，“在第一层直截了当的对立之下...我们发现康拉德[在《黑暗之心》中]的非洲殖民形象与 Achebe 在《瓦解》中的后殖民表现之间有一种潜在的模仿连续性。
Achebe's criticism has become a mainstream perspective on Conrad's work.	Achebe 的批判已经成为研究康拉德作品的主流观点。
The essay was included in the 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel.	这篇文章被收录在 1988 年诺顿批判版的康拉德小说中。
Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book ..." Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books.	编辑 Robert Kimbrough 称其为“自《黑暗之心》第二版以来对其批判的三大最重要事件之一……”，评论家 Nicolas Tredell 将康拉德批判“分为两个划时代的阶段：Achebe 之前和 Achebe 之后。”在人们经常问及他的文章时，Achebe 曾解释说他从未想过放弃这部作品：“谈论禁书并非我的本性。
I am saying, read it – with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about.	我说的是，带着我说的那种理解和知识去阅读。
And read it beside African works." Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": "Conrad was a seductive writer.	并且要连同非洲作品一起阅读。”2009 年 10 月，Achebe 在国家公共广播电台接受了 Robert Siegel 的采访，尽管在题为“《黑暗之心》不妥”的讨论中缓和了这种批判，但仍然保持一致。“康拉德是一位有魅力的作家。
He could pull his reader into the fray.	他可以把他的读者拉到战场。
And if it were not for what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction."	如果不是因为他对我和我的人民所说的话，我可能只会想到这种魅力。”
When he returned to the University of Nigeria in 1976, he hoped to accomplish three goals: finish the novel he had been writing, renew the native publication of Okike, and further his study of Igbo culture.	1976 年回到尼日利亚大学时，他希望达成三个目标：完成他一直写作的小说，更新本土出版物《奥基凯》，并进一步研究伊博文化。
He also showed that he would not restrict his criticism to European targets.	他还表明，他批判的对象并不局限于欧洲。
In an August 1976 interview, he lashed out at the archetypal Nigerian intellectual, who is divorced from the intellect "but for two things: status and stomach.	在 1976 年 8 月的一次采访中，他抨击了典型的尼日利亚知识分子，他们与智力脱节，“只为两点：地位和胃口。
On August 3, 2011, contestants Ricky Jaime and Sasha Mallory danced to "Schoolin Life" in Top 6 Perform round of the eighth season of the American television reality program and dance competition So You Think You Can Dance.	2011 年 8 月 3 日，在美国电视真人秀节目和舞蹈比赛《舞林争霸》第八季的 6 强表演赛中，参赛者 Ricky Jaime 和 Sasha Mallory 跳了“在校生活”。
Their dance performance was choreographed by Kumari Suraj.	他们的舞蹈表演由 Kumari Suraj 编舞。
Gwen Orel of The Wall Street Journal further described their performance during a review of that episode of the show: "He's in a fedora, and she's got a cute short swingy sheer skirt, with thigh high stockings and a garter belt, and a sheer purple blouse.	《华尔街日报》的 Gwen Orel 在对该节目那一集的评论中进一步描述了他们的表演：“他戴着宽沿绅士帽，她穿着可爱的短款摆动式薄纱裙，高筒袜和袜带，还有透明的紫色上衣。
I don’t get what this style really is, it seems to have a lot of arm movements, and some crouching jumps.	我不知道这种风格到底是什么，它似乎有许多手臂动作，还有一些蹲跳。
He doesn’t look quite sharp enough next to her.	他在她旁边看起来还不够犀利。
His split leap is phenomenal."	他的劈叉跳很惊人。”
The base slab, or pylon, of the tomb monument rests on a 38-centimetre (15 in) high plinth, separated by a cornice and concave mouldings.	墓碑的底板也叫塔台，位于 38 厘米（15 英寸）高的底座上，由檐口和凹模隔开。
The pylon is 1.39 metres (4.56 ft) high and 2.02 metres (6.63 ft) wide, decorated with a frieze of winged angel heads (perhaps seraphim) and garlands and ribbons.	塔台高 1.39 米（4.56 英尺），宽 2.02 米（6.63 英尺），装饰有带翅膀的天使头像（可能是六翼天使）和花环及缎带。
Above the pylon, separated by the cornice, are the three Virtues—from left to right, Faith, Charity, and Hope—in shell niches, separated by four Corinthian fluted pilasters.	塔台上方是由檐口隔开的三个美德 - 贝壳壁龛中从左到右是信仰、慈悲和希望，由四个柯林斯式的凹槽壁柱隔开。
Such a motif is unprecedented in Tuscan funerary sculpture but found at this date in Venice, Padua, and especially Cossa's native Naples.	这样的装饰图案在托斯卡纳的墓葬雕塑中前所未有，但在威尼斯、帕多瓦，特别是 Cossa 的故乡那不勒斯都能找到。
As a result, excursions to Venice have been suggested for both Michelozzo and Donatello.	因此，有人建议米开朗琪罗和多纳泰罗去威尼斯考察。
However, Janson suggests that one "need not go all the way to Venice" to find such motifs.	然而，Janson 建议，“不必去往威尼斯”就能找到这样的装饰图案。
Outside Florence, Virtues were common on tombs, with the cardinal Virtues used for laymen, and the theological virtues reserved for ecclesiastics, including the Brancaccio tomb.	在佛罗伦萨以外的地方，墓葬上的美德很常见，红衣主教的美德用于普通教徒，而神学美德留给教会人士，包括 Brancaccio 的墓。
However, the Cossa Virtues, from their hair to their sandals, are more thoroughly antique.	然而，Cossa 美德从他们的头发到他们的凉鞋，都更加彻底地古香古色。
Donatello also produced two similar bronze Virtues for the Siena Baptistry, whose chronological relationship to the Cossa Virtues is unclear.	多纳泰罗还为锡耶纳洗礼堂制作了两件类似的铜制美德，与 Cossa 美德的时间关系尚不清楚。
The 1.05-metre (3.44 ft) tall Faith, to the right of Charity, is holding a Eucharistic chalice; the 1.07-metre (3.51 ft) tall Charity is holding a cornucopia and a brazier (or flaming vase); and the 1.06-metre (3.48 ft) tall Hope, to the left of Charity, has hands clasped in prayer.	“慈悲”的右边是“信仰”，高 1.05  米（3.44 英尺），手持圣餐杯；“慈悲”高 1.07 米（3.51 英尺），手持聚宝盆和火盆（或火焰瓶）；“希望”位于“慈悲”左侧，高 1.06 米（3.48 英尺），双手合十祈祷。
The central figure of Charity is the most antique, assimilating elements of Classical depictions of Abundantia, Ceres, and Juno, all of which were depicted with cornucopias in their left hands.	“慈悲”的中心人物最古老，吸收了对 Abundantia、Ceres 和 Juno 的古典描绘元素，所有这些人都被描绘为左手拿着聚宝盆。
Besides underscoring the antiquity of the tomb monument, the main purpose of the tall yet poorly finished Virtues is to put additional vertical distance between the viewer and the effigy, which has the cumulative effect of de-emphasizing the peculiarities of Cossa, in favor of a generic pontiff (i.e. a potential line of Florentine popes), by blunting the "immediacy" of the trope of lying in state, which was otherwise dominant on Quattrocento wall tombs.	除了强调墓碑的古老性之外，高大但完成度不高的美德的主要目的是增加观者与雕像之间的垂直距离，它具有一种不予强调 Cossa 特性的累积效应，即通过减弱公众瞻仰的“直接性”，有利于普通教皇（即潜在的一系列佛罗伦萨教皇），而这种特质在 Quattrocento 墙上墓葬中占据主导地位。
On top of the sarcophagus, the bier of the effigy is supported by lions whose shape mimics Trecento consoles.	在石棺的顶部，雕像的棺材由形状模仿 Trecento 桌台的狮子支撑。
The lions may be based on the Florentine Marzocco, as if to mark John XXIII in the same manner as a conquered city-state.	这些狮子可能以佛罗伦萨的 Marzocco 为根据，仿佛是以被征服的城邦相同的方式来纪念约翰二十三世。
As Donatello's Marzocco for the papal apartment in Santa Maria Novella conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim.	正如多纳泰罗为新圣母大殿所写的 Marzocco 传达了佛罗伦萨对马丁五世的矛盾态度（既是通过访问获得声望来源，又是共和国的潜在对手），支撑棺材的狮子使得墓碑支持约翰二十三世教皇地位的背景得以巩固，因而成为佛罗伦萨的主张。
Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be taken with a grain of salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous, and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d. 1342) in the Bargello.	然而，对狮子的任何图像学解释都必须谨慎对待，因为狮子象征着混乱，并且在早期坟墓上也视为支撑物，例如 Bargello 的 Lapo de' Bardi（卒于 1342 年）。
The bier and the pall spread over it are tilted towards the viewer with the lion supporting the head standing 2-centimetre (1 in) shorter, increasing the visibility of the effigy, especially the head.	棺材和铺在上面的棺罩向观者倾斜，支撑头部的狮子矮了 2 厘米（1 英寸），增加了雕像的可见度，尤其是头部。
The gilded-bronze, life-size effigy itself makes no attempt to argue for Cossa's papal status, dressing Cossa clearly in the costume of a cardinal; the bedding it rests on is of un-gilt bronze.	真人大小的镀金青铜雕像本身并没有试图为 Cossa 的教皇地位辩护，而是让 Cossa 身着红衣主教服装，它所依靠的垫子是未镀金的青铜。
The opening in the 16th century of the sarcophagus confirmed that Cossa's actual burial clothes matched the effigy.	16 世纪石棺开棺证实了 Cossa 的实际葬服与雕像相符。
There was no precedent for a three-dimensional gilded-bronze effigy on an Italian tomb monument; there was, however, a 6-foot (1.83 m) gilt bronze statue on the balcony of the Palazzo della Briada in Bologna commissioned by Pope Boniface VIII.	在意大利的墓碑上没有三维镀金铜像的先例；不过，在 Bologna 的 Palazzo della Briada 露台上有一尊 6 英尺（1.83 米）的镀金铜像，由教宗波尼法爵八世委托制作。
Chief Wiggum pulls Troy McClure over for dangerous driving.	Wiggum 局长以危险驾驶为由将 Troy McClure 拦下。
Not wishing to be required to wear his glasses while driving, Troy goes to the DMV to get his license changed to remove the requirement.	特洛伊不希望被要求在驾驶时戴眼镜，于是去 DMV 更换了驾照，以解除这一要求。
He offers to take DMV employee Selma Bouvier to dinner if she lets him pass the eye test, to which she agrees.	他提出，如果 DMV 员工 Selma Bouvier 让他通过视力测试，就带她去用餐，她同意了。
After dinner, photographers notice Troy leaving with Selma and the story hits the news.	晚饭后，摄影师注意到 Troy 和 Selma 一同离开，这件事就上了新闻。
The next day, Troy's agent, MacArthur Parker, calls and says that he can get work again if he continues seeing Selma.	次日，Troy 的经纪人 MacArthur Parker 打电话说，如果他继续和 Selma 约会，他就能再次得到工作。
Troy continues to date her and his career begins to recover.	Troy 继续和她约会，他的事业开始恢复。
On his agent's advice, Troy asks Selma to marry him; she agrees.	在经纪人的建议下，Troy 向 Selma 求婚；她同意了。
The night before the wedding, a drunk Troy tells Homer the reason for his marriage: he doesn't really love Selma, and he just plans to use her as a sham wife to help further his career.	在婚礼前夜，喝醉了的 Troy 告诉 Homer 他结婚的原因：他并非真的爱 Selma，只是打算把她佯装妻子来帮助他的事业发展。
Although Homer fails to act, Marge and Patty try to explain it to Selma, who accuses them of just being envious.	虽然 Homer 没有采取行动，但 Marge 和 Patty 试图向 Selma 解释，Selma 指责他们只是嫉妒而已。
She confronts Troy, who shamelessly admits that their marriage is a sham but explains she has everything she could want and will be "the envy of every other sham wife in town".	她与 Troy 对峙，Troy 无耻地承认他们的婚姻是一场骗局，但解释说她拥有她想要的一切，并且会成为“城里其他所有妻子艳羡的对象”。
Selma has doubts, but accepts the situation because she fears being alone.	Selma 带着疑虑，但还是接受了这种情况，因为她害怕孤独。
Parker thinks he can get Troy the part of McBain's sidekick in McBain IV: Fatal Discharge, but concludes he will have a better chance if he has a family.	Parker 认为他可以让 Troy 成为《麦克贝恩 4：致命排放》中 Mcbain 的助手，但他得出结论，如果他有家庭的话机会更大。
Troy and Selma try to conceive a child, but neither feels comfortable with their situation, and Selma finally leaves after deciding that bringing a child into a loveless family is wrong.	Troy 和 Selma 想怀孩子，但两人都对自己的处境感到不称心，Selma 断定把孩子带到一个没有爱的家庭是错误的之后，终于离开了。
During the first half of the end credits, news confirmed that Troy turns down the role of McBain's sidekick to direct and star in his own film, The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.	在谢幕的前半部分，有消息证实，Troy 拒绝了 McBain 的助手角色，执导并主演了自己的电影 《Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel 》。
Show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were fans of actor Phil Hartman, who had been a recurring guest star since the second season.	节目主持人 Bill Oakley 和 Josh Weinstein 是演员 Phil Hartman 的粉丝，他从第二季开始就经常客串。
They decided to produce an episode entirely about his character Troy McClure to give Hartman as much to do as possible.	他们决定制作一集完全关于他的角色 Troy McClure 的节目，以便让 Hartman 尽可能多地发挥。
Oakley wanted to explore Troy's character because he had never interacted with the show's other characters before, only appearing on television.	Oakley 想要探索 Troy 的性格，因为他以前从未与剧中其他角色互动过，只是在电视上出现过。
The writers chose the plot idea of Troy's marriage to Selma Bouvier because she was "always marrying people".	编剧选择了 Troy 与 Selma Bouvier 结婚的情节思路，因为她“总是在和人结婚”。
The episode's first draft was written by freelance writer Jack Barth, although the rest of the writing staff rewrote it.	该集的初稿由自由撰稿人 Jack Barth 撰写，不过其余编剧对它进行了改写。
One aspect of the rewrite was the song "Dr. Zaius" from the Planet of the Apes musical, which the staff consider to be one of the greatest musical numbers ever written for The Simpsons.	改写的一个方面是《人猿星球》音乐剧中的歌曲“Zaius 博士”，工作人员认为这是为《辛普森一家》创作的最伟大的音乐作品之一。
Clair was created for The Cosby Show by series creator, comedian Bill Cosby.	克莱尔是为《考斯比一家》创作的，由该剧集的创作者、喜剧演员比尔考斯比创作。
Cosby originally pitched a series about a detective who solves crime using his wit and humor; Clair's earliest incarnation resembled his character's girlfriend, who is depicted as "a strong woman with her own career." Networks were not interested in developing the series, so Cosby opted for a somewhat more autobiographical approach instead.	考斯比最初提出了一部关于运用他的机智和幽默来解决犯罪问题的侦探连续剧；克莱尔最早的化身类似于他这个角色的女友，她被描述为“一个有自己事业的女强人”。Networks 对制作该剧集不感兴趣，因此考斯比选择了一种带点自传性质的方式。
Cosby eventually based The Cosby Show on his stand-up comedy film Bill Cosby: Himself (1983), which heavily features jokes about his relationship with his wife and their interactions with their children.	考斯比最终以他的单口喜剧电影《比尔考斯比其人》(1983) 为基础拍摄了《考斯比一家》，其中大量笑话关于他与妻子的关系以及他们与孩子的互动。
Clair is based on Cosby's real-life wife Camille.	克莱尔的原型是考斯比现实生活中的妻子卡米尔。
Although the role of the parents in the show evolved dramatically from The Cosby Show's initial inception to final production, the one idea that was retained from Cosby's detective series was the concept of a strong career woman.	尽管从《考斯比一家》最初的构思到最后的制作，剧中父母的角色发生了巨大变化，但从考斯比的侦探剧集中保留下来的一种观点就是职场女强人的概念。
When Cosby originally pitched The Cosby Show to NBC, it revolved around the life of a blue-collar couple; Clair was intended to be a plumber while the character's husband Cliff, portrayed by Cosby himself, was a limousine driver.	在考斯比最初向 NBC 推荐《考斯比一家》时，它围绕一对蓝领夫妻的生活展开；克莱尔打算成为一名水管工，而这个角色的丈夫则是一名豪车司机，由考斯比本人饰演。
Eventually, the idea of Clair working as a plumber was discarded and the character briefly became a Dominican housewife instead.	最终，克莱尔当水管工的构思被抛弃，这个角色变成了一名昙花一现的多米尼加家庭主妇。
Inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I Love Lucy, of whom Cosby was a fan, much of the show's humor would have been directly derived from Clair's tendency to revert to her native language Spanish when upset or agitated.	该剧的灵感来自情景喜剧《我爱露西》中的 Rick Ricardo，考斯比是他的粉丝，该剧的大部分幽默直接源自克莱尔在不开心或激动时倾向于使用母语西班牙语。
Describing this concept as "the reverse of [I Love] Lucy," Cosby explained that the husband "would be the person that didn’t understand when she spoke Spanish" as opposed to the wife.	考斯比将这一概念描述为“[我爱]露西的反面”，他解释说，不是妻子，而是丈夫“成为她说西班牙语时听不懂的人”。
Camille and executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner eventually convinced Cosby that the series should feature a family that resembled their own more closely, specifically one headed by a pair of successful parents with white-collar professions.	卡米尔和执行制片人马西凯瑟以及汤姆华纳最终说服了考斯比，认为该剧应以与他们自己的家庭更接近的家庭为主角，特别是由一对从事白领职业的成功父母领导的家庭。
Thus, Cosby relented and re-wrote Clair and Cliff into a lawyer and doctor, respectively.	于是，考斯比终于同意将克莱尔与克里夫分别改写为律师和医生。
The idea of Clair being Dominican was abandoned before the pilot was filmed.	克莱尔是多米尼加人的构思在试拍之前就被放弃。
However, the character still speaks some Spanish in the first episode and continues to speak the language periodically throughout the series, albeit not as frequently as Cosby had originally intended.	然而，该角色在第一集中仍会说点西班牙语，并在整个剧集中继续经常说这门语言，只不过不像考斯比当初设想的那样频繁。
Cosby borrowed several names from his real-life family for his fictional one; Clair's maiden name is Hanks, which she shares with Camille.	考斯比从他现实生活中的家庭借用了几个名字作为虚构家庭中的名字；克莱尔的婚前姓氏是汉克斯，她与卡米尔都用这个姓氏。
The second season explores each character gaining more responsibility, none more-so than Clair, who is deliberately provided with more storylines to experience and new emotions to express in terms of her relationship with her husband and children.	第二季探讨了每个角色获得更多的责任，尤其是克莱尔，她被刻意提供了更多的故事情节来体验，并在她与丈夫和孩子的关系方面表达新的情感。
Clair is portrayed by American actress Phylicia Rashad.	克莱尔由美国女演员菲利西亚拉斯海德饰演。
In addition to appearing in minor roles on both television and Broadway, Rashad had a recurring role as Courtney Wright on the soap opera One Life to Live before Cosby personally selected her to play his character's wife.	除了在电视和百老汇出演小角色外，在考斯比亲自挑选她饰演他的角色的妻子前，拉斯海德还在肥皂剧《只此一生》中多次饰演 Courtney Wright。
Several actresses auditioned for the role, the majority of whom tended to resort to angrily yelling and moving their heads in a manner similar to that of a bobblehead doll when scolding the child actors playing the character's children during their auditions.	多位女演员参加了该角色的试镜，大多数人在试镜过程中责骂扮演这个角色的孩子的儿童演员时，往往采取愤怒地大喊大叫和类似摇头公仔的方式摇动他们的头部。
However, Rashad's subtle interpretation was different from those of her competitors; when the actress screen tested opposite actor Malcolm Jamal-Warner, who would ultimately go on to portray son Theo, Rashad simply paused, stared and silently gave him "a look" instead of immediately scolding the character that, according to Cosby, meant "four or five things ... and none of them were good." At the end of Rashad's audition, Cosby announced "[Rashad is] Clair" to Carsey.	然而，拉斯海德的微秒解读与她的竞争对手不同；当这位女演员与最终扮演儿子 Theo 的演员马尔科姆贾马尔华纳进行试镜时，拉斯海德只是停顿了一下，盯着他然后默默地给了他“一个眼神”，而不是立即责骂这个角色，据考斯比说，这意味着“四五件事......而且都不是好事。”在拉斯海德试镜结束时，考斯比宣布“[拉斯海德就是]克莱尔”。
Additionally, because Clair was still intended to be of Dominican heritage at the time, Rashad's own bilingualism and fluency in Spanish benefited her successful casting.	此外，由于当时克莱尔的人设仍是多米尼加人，拉斯海德本身的双语能力和流利的西班牙语对她的成功选角受益匪浅。
Most of what is now NY 171 was improved to state highway standards as part of a project contracted out by the state of New York on July 12, 1916.	作为纽约州 1916 年 7 月 12 日外包项目的一部分，如今的 NY 171 大部分路段按州级公路标准进行了改进。
The work covered the 5.10 miles (8.21 km) of the route outside of the Frankfort village limits.	该工程涵盖法兰克福村范围外 5.10 英里（8.21 公里）的路线。
The reconstruction was completed in the 1920s, and the Frankfort Gorge road was added to the state highway system as unsigned State Highway 1346 (SH 1346) by 1926.	重建工作在 20 世纪 20 年代完成，法兰克福峡谷公路在 1926 年作为无标志的 1346 (SH 1346) 州级公路纳入州级公路系统。
In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, SH 1346 became part of NY 171, which continued northeast to Main Street in Frankfort on several state and locally maintained streets.	在 1930 年纽约州级公路重新编号时，SH 1346 成为 NY 171 的一部分，在几个州和当地维护的街道上继续向东北延伸到法兰克福主街。
At the time, Main Street was part of NY 5S, another route assigned as part of the renumbering.	当时，主街所属的 NY 5S 是作为重新编号的一部分分配的另一条路线。
In the late 1960s, a limited-access highway was constructed between Utica and Ilion alongside NY 5S. The new highway became part of a rerouted NY 5S in the early 1970s.	20 世纪 60 年代后期，在 Utica 和 Ilion 之间的 NY 5S 旁边修建了一条限制通行的公路。20 世纪 70 年代初，这条新公路成为改道后的 NY 5S 的一部分。
As a result, NY 171, which does not interchange with the highway, no longer connects to any other signed state routes.	因此，没有与该公路交汇的 NY 171 不再与任何其他有标志的州级道路连通。
NY 171 is the only signed state highway in New York that is completely isolated from the remainder of the state highway system.	NY 171 是纽约州唯一一条有标志的州级公路，与州级公路系统的其余部分完全隔离开来。
In 1992, Sony submitted plans that required approval by the New York City Planning Commission, in which it would take some of the open space in the building's atrium that had been used to obtain approval for additional floors on top of the building, and convert those areas into retail space.	1992 年，索尼提交了需要纽约市规划委员会批准的计划，其中将占用大楼中庭的一些开放空间，并将这些区域改建为零售空间，这些空间曾用于获得大楼顶部额外楼层的审批。
In exchange, the company would expand the glass-enclosed pedestrian walkway with the addition of planters and public seating.	作为交换，该公司将扩大玻璃封闭的人行道，增加花坛和公共座椅。
Sony expected that the proposed conversion of the 8,727 sq ft (810.8 m²) of public space could be converted into stores that could be leased at rates that The New York Times estimated could approach $200 per square foot.	据索尼预计，拟议的 8,727 平方英尺（810.8 平方米）的公共空间可以改建为商铺，据《纽约时报》估计其租赁价格可能接近每平方英尺 200 美元。
The company noted that the space was underutilized as a public amenity because it was "dark, windy and noisy" and that its conversion to commercial space would provide "retail continuity" with the remainder of Madison Avenue.	公司指出，该空间作为公共设施未得到充分利用，因为它“黑暗、风大、嘈杂”，将其改建为商业空间将为麦迪逊大道的其余部分提供“零售连续性”。
By 1996, Sony had consolidated most of the operations for its Sony Music Entertainment division at 550 Madison Avenue, for which The New York Times noted that "such high-profile and elaborate space is appropriate and necessary." That same year, Sony acquired additional space across the street at 555 Madison Avenue, a 445,000 sq ft (41,300 m²) building built in the 1960s that underwent renovations of its lobby, windows, bathrooms and other common spaces in conjunction with Sony's lease.	到 1996 年，索尼将索尼音乐娱乐部门的大部分业务整合到麦迪逊大道 550 号，《纽约时报》指出，“这样高调和精致的空间适当且有必要”。同年，索尼在街对面的麦迪逊大道 555 号购置了额外空间，这是一座建于 20 世纪 60 年代的 445,000 平方英尺（41,300 平方米）的大楼，根据索尼的租约对其大堂、窗户、浴室和其他公共空间均进行了翻新。
Sony signed leases through 2013 on an additional 90,000 sq ft (8,400 m²) on the sixth through ninth floors of the building, on top of an initial rental of 90,000 sq ft (8,400 m²) of space on the second through fifth floors of the building that it had made in 1995.	在 1995 年初次租赁这栋大楼二至五层 90,000 平方英尺（8,400 平方米）空间的基础上，索尼签署了一直到 2013 年的租约，租赁了大楼六到九层的另外 90,000 平方英尺（8,400 平方米）空间。
Rents on the floors had averaged about $34 per square foot at the time.	当时这些楼层的租金平均约为每平方英尺 34 美元。
Sony connected the two buildings using fiber optic cables that were run under Madison Avenue and installed microwave communications equipment on the top of the 555 building.	索尼用光缆将这两栋大楼连通，光缆从麦迪逊大道下面穿过，并在 555 号大楼楼顶安装了微波通信设备。
Sony made these moves, which included early termination of leases on space in the surrounding area at 711 Fifth Avenue on the 43rd floor at 9 West 57th Street, as part of an effort to lower occupancy costs by bringing its businesses closer together.	索尼做出这些举动，包括提前终止位于 9 West 57 街 43 楼的第五大道 711 号周边地区空间租约，是为了通过拉近业务而降低占用成本。
A cash-strapped AT&T sold the building to Sony in 2002 for $236 million, or $315 per square foot.	2002 年，资金拮据的 AT&T 以 2.36 亿美元，即每平方英尺 315 美元的价格将这栋大楼出售给索尼。
The building incorporated the Sony Wonder Technology Lab, a multimedia hands-on tour through the world of media, located in a four-story annex accessible through a glass-roofed atrium that connects 55th and 56th Streets in mid-block.	这栋大楼中有一间索尼奇迹技术实验室，提供遨游于媒体世界的多媒体实践之旅，位于一栋可以通过玻璃屋顶的中庭进入的四层附属建筑中，中庭连接街区中的第 55 和 56 街。
It was open on Tuesdays through Saturdays, and Sony described the free exhibits as a "technology and entertainment museum for all ages".	它在星期二至星期六开放，索尼将其免费展品描述为“适合所有年龄的技术和娱乐博物馆”。
During 2008, the museum's third and fourth floors underwent renovations that were completed in fall 2008.	2008 年间，博物馆三楼和四楼进行了翻新，并于 2008 年秋季竣工。
Sony Wonder replaced Infoquest Center, a permanent telecommunications exhibition that had been built by AT&T.	索尼神奇技术实验室取代了 Infoquest 中心，它是由 AT&T 建造的永久性电信展览馆。
Sony permanently closed the lab on January 29, 2016.	2016 年 1 月 29 日，索尼永久关闭了该实验室。
On February 27, 2010, an accumulation of ice from the February 25–27, 2010 North American blizzard broke loose from an upper floor, breaking the glass ceiling of the atrium and injuring at least 15 inside who were attending a Purim celebration.	2010 年 2 月 27 日，2010 年 2 月 25-27 日北美暴风雪造成的积冰从上层松脱，打破了中庭的玻璃天花板，造成里面至少 15 名正在参加普珥节庆祝活动的人受伤。
In December 2012, bidding started on the building and in January 2013 Sony announced plans to sell the building to the Chetrit Group for $1.1 billion – $685 million more than it had paid for it.	2012 年 12 月，该栋大楼开始招标，2013 年 1 月，索尼宣布计划以 11 亿美元的价格将该栋大楼出售给 Chetrit 集团 - 比曾经为它支付的价格多出 6.85 亿美元。
Sony leased back its offices there through 2016, when it moved its headquarters south to 11 Madison Avenue.	索尼在那里租回了租约一直延续到 2016 年的办公室，将其总部南迁至麦迪逊大道 11 号。
The Chetrit Group planned to redevelop the building as a combination of condominiums and a hotel.	Chetrit 集团计划将该栋大楼重新开发为公寓和酒店的组合。
Chetrit abandoned this plan and sold the building to Olayan and Chelsfield in 2016, relinquishing the "Sony Tower" name.	Chetrit 放弃了这一计划，并在 2016 年将该栋大楼出售给 Olayan and Chelsfield，放弃了“索尼大厦”的名称。
McNicoll relinquished command of HMAS Australia in July 1954 before the cruiser was paid off and marked for disposal the following month, and he briefly returned to duties at the Navy Office.	1954 年 7 月，McNicoll 放弃了对 HMAS 澳大利亚号的指挥权，随后这艘巡洋舰被付清，并在次月标记为处置，他暂时回归海军办公室的职责。
In November, he embarked for London to attend the Imperial Defence College as part of the 1955 course intake, which signified that he had been marked for senior command. McNicoll and his wife, Ruth, had separated in 1950 and their divorce, which cited adultery as the cause, was finalised in October 1956, while the former was still in London.	11 月，作为 1955 年课程入学的一部分，他前往伦敦就读帝国国防学院，这标志着他已经被标记为高级指挥官。McNicoll 和他妻子 Ruth 于 1950 年分居，他们于 1956 年 10 月以通奸为由最终离婚，当时前者仍住在伦敦。
On 17 May the following year, McNicoll wed Frances Mary Chadwick, a journalist, in the Hampstead register office.	次年 5 月 17 日，McNicoll 在 Hampstead 登记处与记者 Frances Mary Chadwick 结婚。
Made acting rear admiral in January 1957, McNicoll was appointed as Head of the Australian Joint Service Staff in London.	1957 年 1 月 McNicoll 被任命为代理海军少将，担任澳大利亚驻伦敦联合服务参谋部主任。
He returned to Australia in February 1958 and was selected to serve as Deputy Secretary (Military) at the Department of Defence; McNicoll's rank was made substantive in July that year.	1958 年 2 月他回到澳大利亚，获选国防部副部长（军事）；同年 7 月 McNicoll 的军衔被定为实职。
On 8 January 1960, McNicoll was posted to the Naval Board in Canberra as Second Naval Member and Chief of Personnel.	1960 年 1 月 8 日，McNicoll 被派往堪培拉海军委员会担任第二海军委员和人事部长。
As noted by historian Ian Pfennigwerth, McNicoll held this position at a time in which recruitment and retention in the Navy particularly lagged behind targets.	正如历史学家 Ian Pfennigwerth 指出的那样，McNicoll 担任这一职务期间的海军招聘和留用工作尤其落后于目标。
McNicoll was additionally appointed as a trustee of the RAN Relief Trust Fund during this period.	在此期间，McNicoll 还被任命为 RAN 救济信托基金的托管人。
Completing his term on the Naval Board, McNicoll was posted as Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet on 8 January 1962 and hoisted his standard aboard HMAS Melbourne, the flagship of the RAN.	完成海军委员会的任期后，McNicoll 于 1962 年 1 月 8 日被任命为 HM 澳大利亚舰队司令官，并在 HMAS 墨尔本号上升起了他的旗帜。
The Australian government had designated the role of the RAN to be primarily one of anti-submarine warfare, a posture which McNicoll thought unwise.	澳大利亚政府已指明 RAN 的作用主要是反潜战，McNicoll 认为这种姿态不明智。
McNicoll argued that surface and air weapons posed a threat equal to that of submarines toward vessels in modern naval warfare.	McNicoll 认为，在现代海战中，水面和空中武器对船只构成的威胁与潜艇对船只的相当。
As such, he campaigned for a contemporary aircraft carrier to replace that of HMAS Melbourne.	因此，他为建造一艘当代航母来取代 HMAS 墨尔本号而奔走呼号。
The Army and Air Force opposed McNicoll's stance, and the government ultimately concluded that there was no strategic requirement for a new carrier in light of agreements contained in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.	陆军和空军反对 McNicoll 的立场，政府最终得出结论，根据东南亚条约组织中的协议，对新航母没有战略要求。
In any event, McNicoll experienced a particularly demanding tenure as Fleet Commander since the RAN was in the process of a complete overhaul of its order of battle and, as a consequence, he had to manage the introduction and deployment into service of six Ton-class minesweepers acquired from the Royal Navy, along with the first batch of Westland Wessex helicopters and modernised afloat support capabilities.	无论如何，McNicoll 作为舰队指挥官经历了特别艰难的任期，因为 RAN 正在对其战斗秩序进行全面改革，因此，他必须管理从皇家海军购买的六艘吨级扫雷舰的引进和部署，以及第一批 Westland Wessex  直升机和现代化的海上支援能力。
Furthermore, McNicoll was charged with the responsibility of ensuring Australian naval commitments to the Far East Strategic Reserve were met.	此外，McNicoll 还负责确保澳大利亚海军对远东战略储备的承诺得到履行。
McNicoll's two-year term as Fleet Commander concluded on 6 January 1964, at which point he returned to the Naval Board as Fourth Naval Member and Chief of Supply.	1964 年 1 月 6 日 McNicoll 结束了作为舰队指挥官的两年任期，这时他重返海军委员会担任第四海军委员和补给部长。
However, this post proved short-lived with his appointment as Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area, headquartered at the land base HMAS Kuttabul in Sydney, from June that year.	然而，这个职位被证明很短暂，因为从该年 6 月起，他被任命为总部设在悉尼的 HMAS Kuttabul 陆地基地的东澳大利亚地区旗官。

The first movement is longer and more complex than any that Mozart had previously composed in the concerto genre.	第一乐章比莫扎特以前创作的任何协奏曲都更长、更复杂。
It is in ; among Mozart's 27 piano concertos, No. 4 in G Major, No.	在莫扎特的 27 首钢琴协奏曲中，G 大调第 4 钢琴协奏曲、
11 in F major and No. 14 in E♭ major are the only others to commence in triple metre.	F 大调第 11 钢琴协奏曲和 E♭ 大调第 14 钢琴协奏曲是唯一以三拍子开始的作品。
The first movement follows the standard outline of a sonata form concerto movement of the Classical period.	第一乐章遵循古典时期奏鸣曲式协奏曲的标准提纲。
It begins with an orchestral exposition, which is followed by a solo exposition, a development section, a recapitulation, a cadenza and a coda.	它以管弦乐呈示部开始，之后是独奏呈示部、发展部、再现部、华彩段和尾声。
Within this conventional outline, Mozart engages in extensive structural innovation.	在这个传统的提纲中，莫扎特进行了广泛的结构创新。
The development begins with the piano repeating its entry to the solo exposition, this time in the relative major of E♭.	发展部开始时，钢琴反复进入独奏呈示部，这次是用 E♭ 的相对大调。
The Concerto No. 20 is the only other of Mozart's concertos in which the solo exposition and the development commence with the same material.	第 20 号协奏曲是莫扎特唯一一首其中的独奏和发展部以相同材料开始的协奏曲。
In the Concerto No. 24, the material unfolds in the development in a manner different from the solo exposition: the opening solo motif, with its half cadence, is repeated four times, with one intervention from the woodwinds, as if asking question after question.	在第 24 号协奏曲中，发展部的材料以不同于独奏呈示部的方式展开；开场独奏主题以半拍重复四次，木管乐器介入一次，仿佛在问一个又一个问题。
The final question is asked in C minor and is answered by a descending scale from the piano that leads to an orchestral statement, in F minor, of the movement's principal theme.	最后一个问题用 C 小调提出，并由钢琴的一个下降音阶来回答，以 F 小调的管弦乐陈述该乐章的主要主题。
The orchestral theme is then developed: the motif of the theme's fourth and fifth measures descends through the circle of fifths, accompanied by an elaborate piano figuration.	管弦乐主题随后得到发展：主题的第四和第五小节的主题通过五度音圈下降，伴随精心制作的钢琴构图。
After this, the development proceeds to a stormy exchange between the piano and the orchestra, which the twentieth-century Mozart scholar Cuthbert Girdlestone describes as "one of the few [occasions] in Mozart where passion seems really unchained", and which Tovey describes as a passage of "fine, severe massiveness".	在此之后，发展部继续进入钢琴和管弦乐队之间的激烈交锋，二十世纪的莫扎特学者 Cuthbert Girdlestone 将其描述为“莫扎特为数不多的激情似乎不受约束的[场合]之一”，而 Tovey 将其描述为一段“精美、排山倒海之势”。
The exchange resolves to a passage in which the piano plays a treble line of sixteenth notes, over which the winds add echoes of the main theme.	交换的结果是钢琴演奏出十六分音符的高音线，管乐在此基础上加入主旋律的回声。
This transitional passage ultimately modulates to the home key of C minor, bringing about the start of the recapitulation with the conventional re-statement, by the orchestra, of the movement's principal theme.	这段过渡性的乐段最终调整为 C 小调的主调，再现部开始，管弦乐队以常规方式再述该乐章的主旋律。
The wide range of thematic material presented in the orchestral and solo expositions poses a challenge for the recapitulation.	管弦乐和独奏呈示部中的主体材料范围广泛，对再现部提出了挑战。
Mozart manages to recapitulate all of the themes in the home key of C minor.	莫扎特设法在 C 小调的主调中再现所有主题。
The themes are necessarily compressed, are presented in a different order, and in their restated form, contain few virtuosic moments for the soloist.	这些主题必然被压缩，以不同的顺序和重述的形式呈现，独奏者技巧性的时刻寥寥无几。
The last theme to be recapitulated is the secondary theme of the orchestral exposition, which has not been heard for some 400 measures and is now adorned by a passage of triplets from the piano.	再现的最后一个主题是管弦乐呈示部的次要主题，它已经有大约 400 小节没有被听到，现在由钢琴的三连音段落来装饰。
The recapitulation concludes with the piano playing arpeggiated sixteenths before a cadential trill leads into a ritornello.	再现部的最后，钢琴弹出了十六分音符的琶音，然后由节奏颤音引出回奏曲。
The ritornello in turn leads into a fermata that prompts the soloist's cadenza.	回奏曲进而又引出提示独奏者华彩段的延音。
"All of Creation" was nominated for two awards at the 42nd GMA Dove Awards: "Song of the Year" and "Pop/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year".	“一切造物”在第 42 届 GMA 圣鸽奖上获得两项提名：“年度歌曲”和“年度流行/当代唱片歌曲”。
It was also nominated for "Christian Song of the Year" at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards.	它还被提名为 2011 年公告牌音乐奖的“年度基督教歌曲”。

News anchor Brian Williams, of NBC Nightly News, guest-starred as himself in this episode.	NBC 晚间新闻的新闻主播 Brian Williams 在这一集里客串他本人。
In a scene with Tracy and Jack at a club, Tracy reveals to Jack that he has been giving out his phone number to different women, though it is not his real number, which results in Williams receiving the calls.	在特蕾西和杰克在俱乐部的一场戏中，特蕾西向杰克透露，他一直在向不同女人告知电话号码，不过并不是他的真实号码，这导致威廉姆斯接到了这些电话。
Kenneth revealing that his real name is "Dick Whitman" is a reference to the main character Don Draper of Mad Men (played by Jon Hamm, who had a recurring role on 30 Rock earlier in the season).	肯尼斯透露他的真名是“迪克惠特曼”，是《广告狂人》中的主角唐德雷柏（由乔哈姆饰演，他在本季早些时候曾在《我为喜剧狂》中扮演过一个经常出现的角色）。
"Earn this", spoken by Kenneth as Jenna has poisoned him again, references the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan when actor Tom Hanks says the same words to actor Matt Damon's title character.	肯尼斯在珍娜再次给他下毒时说的“善待它”，参考了 1998 年的电影《拯救大兵瑞恩》，当时男演员汤姆汉克斯对饰演主角的男演员马特达蒙说了同样的话。
When she is told that Kenneth has gone into a severe allergic shock and needs to have his hands cut off, Jenna apologizes to him for what she has done, telling him "I'm just a girl sitting in front of a boy she poisoned so this other guy would go to town on her", which Jenna misquotes from actress Julia Roberts' character from the romantic comedy Notting Hill (1999).	当她被告知肯尼斯出现了严重的过敏性休克并且需要砍掉他的双手时，珍娜为她的所作所为向他道歉，告诉他“我只是一个坐在她毒害的男孩面前的女孩，会有另一个男人会去城里找她”，珍娜错误地引用了浪漫喜剧《诺丁山》(1999) 中女演员茱莉亚罗伯茨的角色。
After Kenneth drinks his strawberry water, as he risked his life so that Jenna can meet the paramedic again, Jenna says to Kenneth "You magnificent sonofabitch!", a line quoted by actor George C. Scott in the American biographical war film Patton (1970).	肯尼斯喝下草莓水后，冒着生命危险让珍娜再次见到救护人员，珍娜对肯尼斯说“你这个了不起的混蛋！”，这是男演员乔治 C 斯科特在美国传记战争片《巴顿》(1970) 中说过的一句话。
Kenneth blows white smoke out while referencing bringing back something from "the other side" (death) echoes the same look when actor Haley Joel Osment remarked "I see dead people" in the movie The Sixth Sense (1999).	肯尼斯在提到从“另一个世界”（死亡）带回一些东西时吹出了白烟，这与电影《第六感》(1999) 中演员海利乔尔奥斯曼说“我看到死人”的表情相呼应。
The final three clips in the montage of Tracy taking off his shirt are real clips from Tracy Morgan interviews.	特蕾西脱下衬衫的剪辑中的最后三个片段是特蕾西摩根采访的真实片段。
Also, Elisa wears a "What the Frak?!" Battlestar Galactica t-shirt, as she admits her secret to Jack and Liz. "It's not product placement—I just like it!", says Liz to Jack, after he storms into her office and she is wearing a Slanket, a sleeved blanket with sleeves usually made of fleece material.	此外，伊莉莎穿了一件“搞什么？！”的太空堡垒卡拉狄加 T 恤，因为她向杰克和丽兹承认了她的秘密。“这不是产品植入 - 我就是喜欢而已！”，在杰克冲进她办公室后，丽兹这样对他说，她穿着袖毯，一种袖子通常由羊毛材料制成的带袖毛毯。

Caesium is a relatively rare element, estimated to average 3 parts per million in the Earth's crust.	铯是一种相对稀有的元素，据估计在地壳中的平均含量为百万分之三。
It is the 45th most abundant element and the 36th among the metals.	它是第 45 位最丰富的元素，在金属中排名第 36 位。
Nevertheless, it is more abundant than such elements as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, and two orders of magnitude more abundant than mercury and silver; it is 3.3% as abundant as rubidium, with which it is closely associated, chemically.	然而，它比锑、 镉、锡和钨等元素丰富，比汞和银的含量高两个数量级；它的含量是铷的 3.3%，在化学上，它与铷密切相关。
Due to its large ionic radius, caesium is one of the "incompatible elements".	由于其离子半径大，铯是“不相容元素”之一。
During magma crystallization, caesium is concentrated in the liquid phase and crystallizes last.	在岩浆结晶过程中，铯以液相浓缩，最后结晶。
Therefore, the largest deposits of caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process.	因此，最大的铯矿床是由这种富集过程形成的分带伟晶岩矿体。
Because caesium does not substitute for potassium as readily as rubidium does, the alkali evaporite minerals sylvite (KCl) and carnallite (KMgCl	由于铯不像铷那样容易替代钾，碱蒸发岩矿物锡石 (KCl) 和光卤石 (KMgCl

A major theme in this story is that of a symbiotic relationship between a planet and its inhabitants, similar to that in The Word for World Is Forest.	这个故事的主要主题是一个星球与其居民之间的共生关系，与《世界的名字是森林》中的主题相似。
In her introduction to the story, Le Guin stated "We all have forests in our minds.	在这个故事的介绍中，Le Guin 说道：“我们心中都有森林。
Forests unexplored, unending.	未经探索的森林，没有尽头。
Each of us gets lost in the forests, every night, alone." The "vegetable love" referred to in the poem from which the title is taken can be used to describe the final relationship between Osden and the planetary intelligence of World 4470.	每天晚上独自一人时，我们每个人都会在森林里迷路。”标题出处的那首诗中提到的“植物之爱”可以用来描述 Osden 和 4470 世界的行星智能之间的最终关系。
When Osden is attacked by Porlock in the planet, he transmits his fear to the planet, which amplifies it and reflects it back at him.	当 Osden 在这个星球上受到 Porlock 攻击时，他将恐惧传给了星球，而星球将其放大并反射到他身上。
Thus Osden's role is similar to that of Selver in The Word for World is Forest, in that he introduces violence to the forest world.	因此，Osden 的角色类似于《世界的名字是森林》中的 Selver，因为他将暴力引入了森林世界。
The intelligence of Le Guin's forest has been contrasted to the "low" position occupied by vegetative beings in the works of other science fiction authors such as Arthur C. Clarke.	Le Guin 笔下森林的智慧与 Arthur C. Clarke 等其他科幻作家作品中的植物人所占据的“低级”地位形成对比。
An additional similarity between The Word for World Is Forest and "Vaster than Empires" is the theme of first contact between humans and a new environment.	《世界的名字是森林》和《甚于帝国》之间的另一个相似之处是人类与新环境的首次接触的主题。
In "Vaster than Empires," the forest is both the setting for the story and a character in it.	在《甚于帝国》中，森林既是故事的背景，也是其中的一个角色。
The forest directly responds to the humans with fear, a response that is similar to the response of Osden, the empath, to the rest of society: "the normal defensive-aggressive reaction between strangers meeting." Thus Le Guin makes an analogy between contact between humans and aliens, and contact between individual humans; both are contact between the self and the "other".	森林以恐惧直接回应人类，这种回应类似于异能者 Osden 对社会其他人的回应：“陌生人之间相遇时的正常防御 - 攻击回应。”因此 Le Guin 在人类与外星人的接触和人类个体之间的接触之间进行了类比；两者都是自我与“他人”之间的接触。
Osden is depicted as having a strong empathetic connection with the vegetated planet visited by the explorers.	Osden 被描绘为探险家访问的植被星球有着强烈的移情联系。
This is in contrast to the sharply antagonistic relationship that the other members of the team have with him.	这与队伍中其他成员与他的尖锐对立关系形成鲜明对比。
The team is depicted as a dysfunctional group, with each individual having quirks and oddities of their own.	这支队伍被描绘为一个不正常的群体，每个人都有自己的怪癖和奇怪之处。
They are regarded as being of "unsound mind" by the people of Earth and Hain, because they were willing to travel on a voyage that lasted 500 years of actual time.	他们被地球和 Hain 的人视为“心智不全”，因为他们愿意踏上一段实际时间长达 500 年的旅行。
The fear transmitted by the forest drives them further into their neuroticism.	森林传递的恐惧促使他们进一步陷入神经质。
In contrast, Osden the empath surrenders completely to the forest, and thus achieves a mental unity with the planet.	相比之下，异能者 Osden 完全屈服于森林，从而实现了与地球的精神统一。
In choosing a sort of union with the planet, Osden shows that the singular consciousness of the vegetative creature is preferable to the chaos and discord in human society.	在选择与地球的某种结合时，Osden 表明植物性生物的单一意识比人类社会的混乱和不和谐更可取。
At the conclusion of the story Tomiko describes Osden's relationship with the planet, saying "He had taken the fear into himself, and, accepting, had transcended it.	在故事的结尾，Tomiko 描述了 Osden 与这个星球的关系，他说：“他已经把恐惧带给自己，而且接受并超越了它。
He had given up his self to the alien, and unreserved surrender, that left no place for evil.	他已经把自己交给了外星人，毫无保留地投降，没有给邪恶留下任何空间。
He had learned the love of the Other and thereby had been given his whole self." Osden achieves a completely empathetic relationship with the planet, "both literally and figuratively in touch with the forest;" which also grants him temporary goodwill towards humans, as he says "Listen, I will you well" before leaving his colleagues.	他已经学会了对他人的爱，从而得到了他的整个自我。”Osden 与这个星球实现了完全的移情关系，“从字面和象征意义上都与森林建立了联系；”这也赋予了他对人类暂时的善意，正如他在离开同伴前说“听着，我要你好好的”。

Sixteen years before Oceanic 815 crashes on the island, Rousseau was a heavily pregnant member of a six-person crew aboard a French research vessel three days out of Tahiti.	在大洋航空 815 航班在岛上坠毁的 16 年前，Rousseau 是一艘从大溪地出发三天的法国研究船上六名船员中的一名临产期孕妇。
The crew picked up a radio signal emanating from the South Pacific, which was a repeating set of six numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42.	船员接收到一个从南太平洋发出的无线电信号，这是一组重复的六个数字：4、8、15、16、23 和 42。
While attempting to find the source of the signal, the ship ran aground on rocks surrounding the island.	在试图寻找信号来源时，这艘船在岛屿周围的岩石上搁浅。
Before reaching the shore, Rousseau and her team found Oceanic 815 survivor Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) in the water, who had been time-travelling as a result of the time shifts which had been moving him and the flight survivors through the island's history.	在抵达岸边前，Rousseau 和她的团队在水中发现了大洋航空 815 航班的幸存者 Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim)，由于时空穿越，他和航班幸存者在岛上的时间里一直在进行时间旅行。
Rousseau later tells the survivors of Oceanic 815 that two months after their arrival, that the island natives, which she called the Others, carried a disease that the rest of her crew had contracted.	Rousseau 后来告诉大洋航空 815 航班的幸存者，在他们到达两个月后，岛上的土著人也就是她口中的其他人，携带一种疾病，她的其他船员也感染了这种疾病。
She believed that this disease could not be allowed to reach the rest of the world, so she killed her colleagues, including her husband Robert.	她认为不能让这种疾病传播到世界其他地方，所以她杀死了她的同事，包括她的丈夫 Robert。
When Jin time-travels to the past, he witnesses a different version of Rousseau's past.	当 Jin 穿越到过去时，他目睹了 Rousseau 另一个版本的过往。
It is shown that the Smoke Monster, not the Others, was responsible for the "sickness" that forced her to kill her crew.	事实表明，是烟怪而不是其他人，才是迫使她杀死船员的“疾病”的原因。
Rousseau confronts the father of her child, Robert, at gunpoint and accuses him of "being changed" inside the temple.	Rousseau 用枪指着她孩子的父亲 Robert，指责他在神庙里“被变身”。
Robert denies this, explaining that the Monster is a security system for the temple, and convinces Rousseau to lower her weapon.	Robert 否认这一点，解释说烟怪是神庙的安全系统，并说服 Rousseau 放下武器。
He attempts to shoot her when she does, but is shot by Rousseau.	当她照做时，他试图向她开枪，但被 Rousseau 射杀。

Within a few weeks, foals attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months.	在几周内，马驹会尝试吃草，但可能继续哺乳 8-13 个月。
Species in arid habitats, like Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.	干旱栖息地的物种，如细纹斑马，有更长的哺乳间隔，直到三个月大才喝水。
Among harem-holding species, foals are cared for mostly by their mothers, but if threatened by predators, the entire group works together to protect all the young.	在拥有后宫的物种中，马驹主要由它们的母亲照顾，但如果受到捕食者的威胁，整个群体会共同保护所有幼崽。
The group forms a protective front with the foals in the center and the stallion will rush at predators that come too close.	群体形成一个以马驹为中心的保护阵线，公马会冲向靠得太近的捕食者。
In territory-holding species, mothers may gather into small groups and leave their young in "kindergartens" under the guard of a territorial male while searching for water.	在拥有领地的物种中，母亲可能会聚集成小群，在寻找水源时将幼崽留在“幼儿园”，由领地的雄性看管。
Grévy's zebra stallions may look after a foal in his territory to ensure that the mother stays, though it may not be his.	细纹斑马的公马可能会照看自己领地内的马驹，以确保母亲留下来，尽管马驹可能不是它的孩子。
The earliest archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to around 4000-3500 BC.	关于马的驯化，最早的考古学证据来自乌克兰和哈萨克斯坦的遗址，可追溯到公元前 4000-3500 年左右。
By 3000 BC, the horse was completely domesticated, and by 2000 BC, a sharp increase occurred in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent.	直到公元前 3000 年，马才被完全驯化，到公元前 2000 年，在欧洲西北部的人类居住区发现的马骨数量剧增，表明驯化的马遍布整个欧洲大陆。
The most recent, but most irrefutable, evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were buried with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BC.	最近但也是最无可辩驳的驯化证据来自于公元前 2100 年左右 Sintashta 和 Petrovka 文化的坟墓，遗址中马的遗骸与战车埋葬在一起。
Studies of variation in genetic material shows that very few wild stallions, possibly all from a single haplotype, contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds.	对遗传物质变异的研究表明，很少有野生公马可能全部来自单倍型，对家马有贡献，而许多母马是早期驯化畜群的一部分。
Przewalski's horse has been conclusively shown not to be an ancestor of the domestic horse, though the two can hybridize and produce fertile offspring.	普氏野马已被最终证明为不是家马的祖先，尽管两者可以杂交并产生可生育的后代。
The split between Przewalskii's horse and E. ferus caballus is estimated to have occurred 120,000– 240,000 years ago, long before domestication.	普氏野马和 E. ferus caballus 之间的分裂估计发生在 120,000– 240,000 年前，远在驯化之前。
Of the caballine equines of E. ferus, E. f. ferus, also known as the European wild horse or "tarpan", shares ancestry with the modern domestic horse.	在 E. ferus 的马科中，E. f. ferus 也被称为欧洲野马或“草原野马”，与现代家马有着共同的祖先。
In addition, tarpans that lived into modern times may have been hybridized with domestic horses.	此外，活到现代的草原野马可能已经与家马杂交。
In the early 20th century, "Nkosi Sikielel' iAfrika" was becoming popular with black Africans.	20 世纪初，“Nkosi Sikielel' iAfrika”开始在非洲黑人中流行。
In Southern Rhodesia it was originally sung in the original Xhosa language before being translated into Shona which created "Ishe Komborera Africa".	在南罗得西亚，它最初用原始的科萨语演唱，然后被翻译成创造了“上帝保佑非洲”的绍纳语。
The new Shona language hymn was first performed at the start of a meeting of the Southern Rhodesia Native Association and then again four days later at the closure of the first meeting of the Bantu National Congress, which the Southern Rhodesia Native Association later became affiliated to.	这首新的绍纳语赞美诗首次在南罗得西亚原住民协会的会议开始时演唱，四天后在班图国民大会第一次会议闭幕时再次演唱，南罗得西亚原住民协会后来成为该协会的附属机构。
By the 1948 African General Strike, it had become the main political song amongst black Africans.	到 1948 年非洲大罢工时，它已经成为非洲黑人的主要政治歌曲。
Despite that connotation, the song was accepted by black and white Rhodesians.	尽管有这样的内涵，这首歌还是被罗得西亚的黑人和白人所接受。
In 1951, at a British South African Police athletics competition, "Ishe Komborera Africa" was sung by combined black and white policemen to commemorate the first multi-racial competition in Southern Rhodesia.	1951 年，在英国南非警察田径比赛中，“上帝保佑非洲”由黑人和白人警察联合演唱，以纪念南罗得西亚的第一次多种族比赛。
Following Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the British Empire, the new Rhodesian authorities started to crack down on African liberation movements.	在罗得西亚单方面宣布脱离大英帝国独立后，新的罗得西亚当局开始镇压非洲解放运动。
One of their considerations was to ban performance of "Ishe Komborera Africa" in African schools and public performance of it often made people liable for arrest by the British South African Police.	他们的考量因素之一是禁止非洲学校表演“上帝保佑非洲”，而公开表演经常导致人们被英国南非警察逮捕。
The District Commissioner for Gutu abolished the Gutu African Council after its leader opened a meeting by singing "Ishe Komborera Africa" in the District Commissioner's presence.	在古图非洲议会领导人在一次会议上当着区专员的面唱了“上帝保佑非洲”后，古图区专员废除了该议会。
The Commissioner also had the leader arrested but he was released without charge.	专员还逮捕了该领导人，但他被无罪释放。
Following the Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980, after Zimbabwe Rhodesia returned to British control as Southern Rhodesia, Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union party won to become the first government of an independent Zimbabwe.	1980 年南罗得西亚大选后，津巴布韦罗得西亚作为南罗得西亚回归英国控制，罗伯特穆加贝领导的津巴布韦非洲民族联盟党获胜，成为独立津巴布韦的第一届政府。
After this, "Ishe Komborera Africa" was selected to replace the official "God Save the Queen" of Southern Rhodesia and the unofficial "Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia" of Rhodesia as the national anthem of an independent Zimbabwe as it was a symbol of black African struggles and solidarity against apartheid systems in South Africa and Namibia.	此后，“上帝保佑非洲”被选为独立津巴布韦的国歌，取代南罗得西亚的的官方国歌“天佑女王”和罗得西亚的非官方国歌“扬起罗得西亚的声音”，因为它是非洲黑人反对南非和纳米比亚种族隔离制度的斗争和团结的象征。
At the Zimbabwean independence ceremony, the Union Jack was lowered to "God Save the Queen" and the new flag of Zimbabwe was raised to "Ishe Komborera Africa" in Salisbury.	在津巴布韦独立仪式上，降下英国国旗时奏响“天佑女王”，在索尔兹伯里升起津巴布韦新国旗时奏响“上帝保佑非洲”。
In 1994, it was deemed that Zimbabwe should change its national anthem to avoid similarities with other countries who used the tune of "Ishe Kombererra Africa".	1994 年，人们认为津巴布韦应改变其国歌，以避免与其他使用“上帝保佑非洲”的曲调的国家相似。
Tanzania used "Mungu ibariki Afrika", Zambia used "Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free" (to the same tune) and Transkei who used "Nkosi Sikielel' 'Afrika".	坦桑尼亚使用“Mungu ibariki Afrika”，赞比亚使用“独立高歌赞比亚，自豪又自由”（曲调相同），特兰斯凯使用“Nkosi Sikielel' 'Afrika”。
It was also because Mugabe wanted to develop a new distinctly Zimbabwean identity with a unique national anthem.	这也是因为穆加贝想用一首独特的国歌来发展津巴布韦独特的新身份。
A contest was held to determine a new national anthem and "Simudzai Mureza wedu weZimbabwe" by Solomon Mutswairo was chosen.	为确定新国歌，举行了一场比赛，Solomon Mutswairo 的“Simudzai Mureza wedu weZimbabwe”被选中。
The new anthem was promoted prior to "Ishe Komborera Africa" being replaced as the official national anthem.	在“上帝保佑非洲”被官方国歌取代前，新国歌得到了宣传。
However, there was scepticism from Christians about the need for replacing "Ishe Komborera Africa" with the belief that it was part of a plan by ZANU-PF to remove references to God from Zimbabwe's official proceedings.	然而，基督徒对取代“上帝保佑非洲”的必要性持怀疑态度，认为这是 ZANU-PF 计划的一部分，目的是在津巴布韦的官方程序中免除对上帝的提及。
The change of anthem from "Ishe Komberera Africa" was later confirmed by the Parliament of Zimbabwe in 1995 by the passage of the National Anthem of Zimbabwe Act 10:15.	津巴布韦议会后来于 1995 年通过了津巴布韦国歌法 10:15，确认了“上帝保佑非洲”国歌的改变。

Pierre 引用 Waits 的话说，“所有人都在模仿他们最喜欢的艺术家 - 很糟糕，”并补充道，“我们只是在照搬 80 年代末和 90 年代初听过的所有垃圾音乐，就是这些音乐让我们一开始踏上玩音乐的道路。”
The band's musical style is widely recognizable by its unique blend of pop punk with the Moog synthesizer.	乐队的音乐风格因其流行朋克与 Moog 合成器的独特融合而得到广泛认可。
The usage of the Moog stems from Cain, who first heard the instrument employed on the Rentals' album Return of the Rentals (1995).	Moog 的使用源于 Cain，他第一次在 Rentals 乐队的专辑《Rentals 回归》(1995) 中听到使用了这种乐器。
He subsequently bought a cheap Moog at a pawn shop and wanted it to be an integral part of Motion City upon their formation.	后来他在当铺买了一个便宜的 Moog，并希望它在 Motion City 成立后成为他们不可或缺的一部分。

In his review of the song, Unterberger of Popdust noted Hit-Boy's modern hip hop production, saying "Diplo and Bangladesh might have to watch their back after the up-and-comers contributions to this album." Adam Fleischer of XXL said "Nicki dishes boast-heavy verses about how she’s better than all these other bitches."	Popdust 的 Unterberger 在对这首歌的评论中指出了 Hit-Boy 的现代嘻哈制作，他说“在后起之秀对这张专辑做出贡献后，Diplo 和 Bangladesh 得小心了。”XXL 的 Adam Fleischer 说：“Nicki 用夸张的主歌讲述了她是如何超越其他所有人的 。”

Andrew Hampp of Billboard echoed Unterberger's sentiments, saying "The nostalgia of Cam's return trumps the overall catchiness of the song." XXL Magazine stated that "Though many of the early songs [on the album] lack real substance, the records remain generally exciting - “I Am Your Leader,” alongside Rick Ross and Cam’ron, “Beez In The Trap” with 2 Chainz, and the triumphant “Champion” featuring Nas, Drake and Young Jeezy are all memorable moments".	Billboard 的 Andrew Hampp 与 Unterberger 的观点不谋而合，他说：“ Cam 的回归带来的怀旧感胜过这首歌的整体吸引力。”XXL 杂志指出“尽管[专辑中的]许多早期歌曲缺乏真正的内涵，但唱片总体上仍然很出彩 - 与 Rick Ross 和 Cam’ron 一起制作的‘我是你们的领袖’，与 2 Chainz 一起制作的‘Beez 的陷阱’，以及与 Nas、Drake 和 Young Jeezy 一起制作的‘冠军’都是令人难忘的时刻”。

Paste 杂志的 Stephen Deusner 说：“在押韵的‘我是你们的领袖’中，[Minaj] 又吐出了一个像操场上的嘲笑一样的阴茎笑话，狡猾地破坏了嘻哈音乐传统上以男性为中心的吹牛。

David Jeffries of Allmusic listed it as one of the best tracks on the album.	Allmusic 的 David Jeffries 将其列为专辑中最好的曲目之一。

Ian Johnson argued Dafoe's casting was "rare" and "somewhat offbeat".	伊恩•约翰逊辩称，达福的选角“罕见”、“有些另类”。
Journalist Raju Mudhar also wrote that in this episode, "The Simpsons have succinctly laid out our eventual future."

By end of the 16th century Cassel had become a border town between France and the Spanish Netherlands.	到 16 世纪末，卡塞勒已经成为法国与西属尼德兰之间的边境城镇。
The French repeatedly fought with Spain and later the independent Dutch Republic for control of the town; in March 1645, Gaston, Duke of Orléans seized it but lost it again to the Spanish a few months later.	法国多次与西班牙交战，随后又与独立的荷兰共和国交战，争夺该镇的控制权；1645 年 3 月，奥尔良公爵加斯东夺取该镇，但几个月后再次被西班牙夺走。
In 1658 Turenne expelled two Irish regiments in the pay of the Spanish who were garrisoning Cassel.	1658 年，杜伦尼驱逐了两个受雇于西班牙驻守卡塞勒的军团。
The French captured the town in July 1676 under Louis de Crevant, Duke of Humières and strengthened the castle.	1676 年 7 月，在休米埃尔公爵路易斯•德•克雷万特的率领下攻占该镇并加固了城堡。
The following year, a third Battle of Cassel took place just west of the town on 11 April 1677 when a French army under François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg and Philippe I of Orléans defeated Dutch forces commanded by William III of Orange.	次年，即 1677 年 4 月 11 日，卡塞勒的第三场战役发生在该镇以西，由卢森堡公爵弗朗索瓦•亨利•德•蒙莫朗西和奥尔良公爵飞利浦一世率领的法国军队击败了由奥兰治的威廉三世指挥的荷兰军队。
The battle took place after King Louis XIV of France besieged the Dutch-held town of Saint-Omer during the Franco–Dutch War.	这场战役发生在法荷战争期间法国国王路易十四围攻荷兰控制的圣奥梅尔镇之后。
William sent an army to relieve Saint-Omer but was defeated at the village of Zuytpeene just to the west of Cassel, losing 7-8,000 men killed or wounded and another 4,000 taken prisoner.	威廉派出一支部队解救圣奥梅尔，但在卡塞勒以西的聚伊佩讷村被击败，伤亡 7-8,000 人，另有 4,000 人被俘。
Saint-Omer fell a week later.	一个星期后圣奥梅尔沦陷。
Cassel was annexed to France the following year under the terms of the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war.	次年，根据奈梅亨条约条款，卡塞勒被法国吞并，战争结束。
The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills.	这次吞并导致该镇的防御工事遭到拆除；由于该镇在附近的 Mont des Récollets 的射程范围内，而且对两座山构筑防御工事的成本太高，所以该镇被认为无法防守。
In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without the proximity of the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.	此外，根据该条约，修改后的边境现在距离卡塞勒很远而且不靠近边界，因此该镇不再被认为具有太大战略意义。
During the French Revolutionary Wars, Cassel is said to have been the hill up which the Grand Old Duke of York marched his 10,000 men before he "marched them down again".	在法国大革命战争期间，据说卡约克大公爵在“再次率领军队出征”之前，卡塞勒的山丘是他的 10,000 名士兵行军的地方。
While it is true that Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, did command an army in the Flanders Campaign of 1793 and was probably in the vicinity, the link with Cassel is considered dubious as the eponymous nursery rhyme appears to have originated well before the Revolutionary Wars.	虽然约克和奥尔巴尼公爵弗雷德里克王子确实在 1793 年的弗兰德里战役中指挥了一支军队，并且很有可能就在附近，但与卡塞勒的关系仍然可疑，因为在革命战争爆发之前，同名儿歌似乎早已出现。

Benjamin Disraeli, later to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, stayed there for a month in September–October 1845 and wrote in a letter to his sister Sarah that he considered it "an extremely savage place; few of the inhabitants, & none of the humbler classes, talk French, there is no library, bookseller's shop, nor newspaper of any sort ...	1845 年 9 月至10 月，后来成为英国首相的本杰明•迪斯雷利在该处住了一个月，他在给姐姐萨拉的信中写道，他认为那里是“极其野蛮的地方；很少有居民而且没有下层阶级的人讲法语，没有图书馆、书店，也没有任何形式的报纸……
It is quite French Flanders, their provisions come from Holland, the Hotel de Ville was built by the Spaniards, the carillons are perpetually sounding, & religion is supreme."	这里简直就是法国的弗兰德斯，他们的粮食来自荷兰，市政厅由西班牙人建造，钟琴永远在响，宗教至高无上。”
In 1848, Cassel gained a railway connection when the Lille-Dunkirk line was built.	1848 年，在里尔-敦刻尔克铁路线建成后，卡塞勒连通了一条铁路。

During first two months of the functioning of the camp, local residents killed three thousand people within it.	在集中营运作的头两个月里，当地居民在营地内屠杀了三千人。
At the end of July 1941, the Ustaše, under the command of Boško Cvjenćek, captured and transported a group of 74 Serbs from Pale to the Kruščica camp with the false explanation that they were going to work and earn money.	1941 年 7 月末，在博斯科·茨维延切克的指挥下，乌斯塔沙组织从帕莱俘虏了 74 名塞尔维亚人并将他们运送到克鲁什卡集中营，谎称他们要去工作和赚钱。

According to a 2001 work published by Hrvatski informativni centar and authored by Topalović, imprisoned Serbs were actually political prisoners who attacked the Ustaše, attempting to kill them, refusing all calls for surrender, so the Ustaše were forced to kill them.	根据由 Hrvatski informativni centar 发表并由托帕洛维奇撰写于 2001 年的文章所述，被监禁的塞尔维亚人实际上是袭击乌斯塔沙组织的政治犯，他们曾试图杀害组织成员并拒绝所有投降要求，因此乌斯塔沙组织被迫将他们杀害。
Topalović also emphasized that the Ustaše commander of the camp, Josip Tehler was killed attempting to suppress the rebellion.	托帕洛维奇还强调，集中营的乌斯塔沙组织指挥官约瑟普·特勒在镇压叛乱时遭杀害。

It was difficult to accommodate and feed the inmates of this camp, so the Ustaše decided to resolve this difficulty by torturing inmates with forced labour and hunger and by killing them.	这个集中营已难以容纳并提供食物给这些囚犯，因此乌斯塔沙组织决定通过强迫劳动和饥饿折磨囚犯并将他们杀害以解决这一困难。
The camp was destroyed after the Second World War.	该营地在第二次世界大战后被摧毁。
One building was restored, and a memorial area, occupying around 2,000 m² was established, consisting of the restored building (containing a museum), a monument created by Fadil Bilić, incorporating a text from Ivan Goran Kovačić's poem Jama, and several memorial plaques commemorating communities interned in the camp (including those from Zenica and Pale).	人们修复了一栋建筑，并建立了一个占地约 2,000 平方米的纪念区，其中包括经修复的建筑（包含博物馆）、由法迪尔·比利奇创建的纪念碑（其中包含伊万·戈兰·科瓦契奇诗歌《Jama》中的文字），以及几块用以纪念被囚禁在集中营的社区（包括来自泽尼察和帕莱的社区）的纪念碑。

He agreed to accept the role, noting the spiritual issues in the story and the impact it had on him, but not elaborating on his own beliefs.	他同意接受这个角色，并特别提到故事中的宗教问题及其对自身的影响，但他并没有详细讲述自身的信仰。

He remarked on having to adopt the mindset of a child, and act impressed by commonplace experiences such as feeling rain or sunlight.	他表示必须采用孩童的心态，要在感受雨水或阳光这样的普通事物时表演出惊喜感。
A rig for the camera was built for the scene where the angelic Seth sees Maggie look in the mirror, and the crew shot the mirror without the actors for one take so Cage's reflection could be edited out from the take with both.	剧组为天使赛斯看着梅姬照镜子的场景构建了一套摄影机装置，剧组人员在没有演员的情况下拍摄了一组镜子镜头，以使凯奇的倒影可以从二人的镜头中剪辑掉。

The library scenes were shot at San Francisco Public Library.	图书馆的场景是在旧金山公共图书馆拍摄的。

With the entry of Japan into the war, Fairley flew to Java in January 1942.	随着日本参战，费尔利于 1942 年 1 月飞往爪哇。
Fairley was well aware that Java produced 90% of the world's supply of quinine and that the implications would be serious if Java was lost.	费尔利非常清楚，爪哇的奎宁产量达全球供应量的 90%，如果失去爪哇，后果将十分严重。
He arranged for the purchase of all available stocks of quinine, some 120 long tons (120 t).	他安排购买了所有可用的奎宁库存，大约 120 长吨 (120 t)。
Fairley was informed that the quinine had been loaded on board two ships.	费尔利被告知奎宁已被装运到两艘船上。
One was never seen again.	一艘再未露面。
The other, the SS Klang, reached Fremantle in March.	另一艘 SS Klang 于 3 月抵达弗里曼特尔。
Although 20 long tons (20 t) of quinine was loaded on board, it was apparently unloaded when the ship stopped at Tjilatjap, possibly due to fifth columnists.	尽管船上载有 20 长吨 (20 t) 奎宁，但显然当船停靠在芝拉札时有人将奎宁卸下了船，这可能是由第五纵队所为。
Thus, none of the shipment reached Australia.	因此，所有货物均未抵达澳大利亚。
Fairley himself departed Java with the I Corps staff on the transport Orcades on 21 February 1942 shortly before Java fell.	1942 年 2 月 21 日，在爪哇沦陷前不久，费尔利本人和第一军参谋部乘坐奥尔凯得斯运输船离开爪哇。

Fairley was soon facing a series of medical emergencies caused by the Kokoda Track campaign.	费尔利很快就面临了由科科达小径战役引起的一系列医疗紧急情况。
An epidemic of bacillary dysentery was headed off by Fairley's decision to rush all available supplies of sulphaguanadine to New Guinea.	费尔利决定将所有可用的磺胺胍物资火速运往新几内亚，从而阻止了细菌性痢疾的流行。
On Fairley's advice every man who complained of diarrhoea was given the drug and the epidemic was brought under control in ten days.	在费尔利的建议下，每个饱受腹泻困扰的人都得到了这种药物，流行病在十天内便得到了控制。
But Fairley's main concern was malaria.	但费尔利主要关心的是疟疾。
Despite the experience with malaria in the Middle East, most of the troops had a poor understanding of anti-malaria precautions and few medical officers had encountered the disease.	尽管在中东有过应对疟疾的经验，但大多数部队对于对抗疟疾的预防措施都知之甚少，很少有军医遇到过这种疾病。
In combination with critical shortages of drugs and anti-malarial supplies such as netting, insecticides and repellents, the result was a medical disaster.	再加上药物以及诸如蚊帐、杀虫剂和驱虫剂等抗疟疾物资严重短缺，结果造成了一场医疗灾难。
In the 13-week period from 31 October 1942 to 1 January 1943, the Army reported 4,137 battle casualties, but 14,011 casualties from tropical diseases, of which 12,240 were from malaria.	在 1942 年 10 月 31 日至 1943 年 1 月 1 日为期 13 周的时间内，军队报告了 4,137 例因战斗造成的人员伤亡，但有 14,011 人死于热带病，其中 12,240 人死于疟疾。
The government grimly contemplated disbanding divisions to replace malaria casualties.	政府严肃地考虑解散陆军师以免于疟疾伤亡。
"Our worst enemy in New Guinea," General Blamey declared, "is not the Nip—it’s the bite."	“我们在新几内亚最大的敌人，”布莱米将军宣称，“不是交战——而是咬伤。”
This caused Blamey to despatch a medical mission headed by Fairley to the United States and the United Kingdom in September 1942 to present the Army's case for a more adequate and equitable share of anti-malarial supplies.	这导致布莱米于 1942 年 9 月派遣了由费尔利带头的医学传教队前往美国和英国，为其展示为陆军提供更加充足和公平的抗疟疾物资份额的案例。
Illinois farmer David Johnson built his 31-foot-tall (9.4 m) goat tower in Shelby County, near Findlay, after seeing an article on Fairview in the magazine Decanter.	伊利诺斯州农场主大卫-约翰森在看过 Decanter 杂志上一篇关于 Fairview 的文章后，在谢尔比县芬德雷附近建了一座 31 英尺（9.4 米）高的山羊塔。

Life at the Bottom has received mostly positive reviews.	Life at the Bottom 获得的几乎都是正面的评论。
Gregory Schneider of the Topeka Capital-Journal called the collection "the best exploration of the problems of poverty ever written." America magazine writer, Peter Heinegg, considered the essays to be a "barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life...stories", but he said that Dalrymple puts too much of his personal "snorting indignation" into the text without letting the reader draw their own conclusions.	Topeka Capital-Journal 的 Gregory Schneider 将此系列称为“有史以来贫困问题的最佳探索。”美国杂志记者彼得-海内格认为这些随笔是“一连串非常可怕的真实生活...故事”，但他认为达尔林普尔在文字中倾注了太多个人的“义愤”，而不是让读者去得出自己的结论。
He ended by saying, "Dalrymple's case sounds like a paranoid tirade or perverse tribute, but it is at least partially redeemed by the barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life (one assumes) stories that this very angry doctor tells...to bolster it." John Clark of Liberty magazine called it "so compelling...that I read it cover to cover in a day's time—and later reread it twice."	他最后说，“达尔林普尔的情况听起来像偏执的长篇大论或有悖常理的颂词，但这位非常愤怒的医生所讲述的一连串非常可怕的真实故事起了作用，至少一部分掩盖了这点。”Liberty 杂志的约翰-科拉克称之为“非常扣人心弦...我一天就看完了—后来又看了两遍。”
Thomas Sowell, a pundit and social critic, described it as "brilliant and insightful" in Capitalism magazine and "an insightful and devastating eyewitness account of the white underclass in Britain" in the Jewish World Review.	学者兼社会批评家汤姆斯-苏维尔在《资本主义》(Capitalism) 杂志中将其描述为“技巧高超，见解深刻”，在《犹太世界评论》(Jewish World Review) 中将其描述为“英国白人下层社会见解深刻、令人震惊的现场报道”。
Overall, Sowell said that the collection was able to explain that "One of the most telling examples of the social destructiveness of the left's welfare-state vision can be found among the white slum dwellers in Britain." Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer, Theresa K. Weaver, called the collection "saddening, infuriating, and ultimately not terribly empowering", stating that she wishes Dalrymple "might at least offer a few ideas on turning everything around." Arthur Foulkes of the Carolina Journal described it as a "fine book" that "offers much to friends of liberty everywhere." Roger Donway of The Atlas Society considered it to be "one of the most instructive books that I have read in many years".	总而言之，苏维尔认为，这个系列能够说明“在英国白人贫民区中能找到福利国家愿景对社会破坏性的最生动示例。”Atlanta Journal-Constitution 记者特雷莎-K-韦弗称该系列“令人悲伤、愤怒并最终给人以可怕的力量”，表示她希望达尔林普尔“至少提供一些能让一切好转的方法。”Carolina Journal 的 阿瑟-福克斯将其描述为一本“好书”，“给各地追求自由的朋友很多启发。”The Atlas Society 的罗杰-康维认为它是“我多年来读过的最有启发性的书籍之一”。
Stephen Goode, writing for Insight on the News, said that the collection argued its "position brilliantly and with impressive passion".	史蒂芬-古德在为 Insight on the News 撰文时说，该系列坚持其“立场，观点鲜明，激情洋溢”。
The National Observer wrote that it "has much value", if it is taken as an "antidote to fashionable loose thinking".	国家观察员认为，如果将它作为“流行的宽松思想的解药”，将“非常有价值”。

Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph.	几乎所有新英格兰人都一致反感安道尔和兰道夫。
Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in 1683-4, does not seem to have carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.	菲普斯尽管在 1683-4 年曾担任兰道夫炮艇的舰长，但在马萨诸塞湾人们的心中，他似乎与兰道夫没有什么关联。
Andros swore Phips into his new post in early July, but his council refused Phips' demand that the previously named sheriffs be dismissed.	安道尔郑重承诺在 7 月初为菲普斯安排新职位，但议会拒绝了菲普斯要求解雇以前任命的治安官的提议。
If Phips had simply wanted a share in the spoils of the Dominion, he might have stuck around and kept his head down.	如果菲普斯只想在自治领的权力中占据一席之地，他可能会在一旁等着，保持低调。
Instead he stayed home in Boston only six weeks before shipping back to London to join with Increase Mather in opposing the Dominion and seeking to restore the original charter.	但他在波士顿的家中只待了六个星期，然后坐船去了伦敦，加入了因克瑞斯-马瑟，反对自治领，寻求恢复原始宪章。
This seems to be the first mention of Phips in Increase Mather's diary or correspondence.	这好像是因克瑞斯-马瑟的日记或通信中第一次提到菲普斯。
Motivated by a shared dislike of Andros, Phips and Increase Mather worked together to bring about his downfall.	菲普斯和因克瑞斯-马瑟都不喜欢安道尔，于是他们俩一起促成了他的下台。
After the Glorious Revolution in late 1688 replaced the Catholic James with the Protestant monarchs William III and Mary II, Phips and Mather petitioned the new monarchs for restoration of the Massachusetts charter, and successfully convinced the Lords of Trade to delay the transmission of formal instructions about the change of power to Andros.	在 1688 年末“光荣革命”后，天主教的詹姆斯换成了新教君主威廉三世和玛丽二世，菲普斯和马瑟请求新君主恢复马萨诸塞宪章，并且成功地说服了议院延迟发布关于安道尔权力变更的正式指令。
Phips returned to Boston in May 1689, carrying proclamations from the king and queen, and found Andros and Randolph had already been arrested in a revolt in Boston.	菲普斯在 1689 年 5 月回到波士顿，带着国王和王后的公告，但发现安道尔和兰道夫已经在波士顿的叛乱中被捕入狱。
Phips served for a time as an overseer guarding Andros and Randolph in the prison at Castle Island.	菲普斯一度在城堡岛的监狱负责监管安道尔和兰道夫。
If Paris were worth a mass to Henry IV, Boston was worth a conversion, in the Puritan sense, to William Phips.	对于清教徒而言，如果巴黎可以推举亨利五世，波士顿也能推举威廉-菲普斯。
The turmoil in England and William's accession to the throne had prompted New France's Governor to take advantage of the political turmoil in New England, launching a series of Indian raids across the northern frontier in 1689 and early 1690.	英格兰的骚乱和威廉登上王座刺激新法兰西总督利用新英格兰的骚动情绪，在 1689 年和 1690 年初在北部边境发动一系列对印第安的劫掠。
When a frontier town in Maine was overrun in early March 1690, the French were perceived as instigators and the provisional government of Massachusetts, began casting about for a major general to lead an expedition against the French in Acadia.	当缅因州的边境小镇在 1690 年 3 月初被占领时，法国人被视为唆使者，马萨诸塞临时政府开始寻找将军带人远征阿卡迪亚的法国人。
Phips had not demonstrated military interests as a young man.	作为一名年轻人，菲普斯尚未表现出军事上的兴趣。
During King Philip's War, when many took up arms, Phips built ships and cut lumber.	在菲利浦国王战争期间，很多人拿起武器，菲普斯却在造船和伐木。
John Knepp's journal testifies to Phips constitutional disinterest in military discipline.	约翰-尼谱的日记证实，菲普斯天生对军事没有兴趣。

In a review published by Mint, Shefalee Vasudev criticised the writing style as "too-breezy" but further stated that it is "a well-produced book, reproducing chirpy little post-it notes and diet charts, punctuated with Bebo's stunning pictures from her private albums to fashion magazine covers." Later that year, she collaborated with Diwekar for the third time on The Indian Food Wisdom and The Art of Eating Right, a documentary film about nutrition.	在 Mint 发表的评论中，沙法利-瓦苏杰夫评述其文风“太过活泼”，但进一步说它是“一本精心编写的书，再现了活泼的小便利贴记事和饮食图表，其间点缀以 Bebo 从私人相册到时尚杂志封面的精美图片。”当年晚些时候，她与迪维卡第三次合作出版了一部关于营养的记录片《The Indian Food Wisdom and The Art of Eating Right》。

On 30 July 1502, during his fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, one of the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras.	1502 年 7 月 30 日，克里斯多弗·哥伦布在他的第四次航行中，抵达了洪都拉斯海岸外的海湾群岛之一瓜纳哈。
He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island.	他派他的兄弟巴塞洛缪去侦察这座岛。
As Bartholomew explored the island with two boats, a large canoe approached from the west, apparently en route to the island.	当巴塞洛缪带领两艘船探索这座岛时，一艘大型独木舟从西边驶来，显然也是要去这座岛。
The canoe was carved from one large tree trunk and was powered by twenty-five naked rowers.	独木舟由一根大树干雕刻而成，上面有二十五个裸身的桨手在划船。
Curious as to the visitors, Bartholomew Columbus seized and boarded it.	巴塞洛缪·哥伦布对来访者感到好奇，他抓住并登上了船。
He found it was a Maya trading canoe from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo that included ceramics, cotton textiles, yellow stone axes, flint-studded war clubs, copper axes and bells, and cacao.	他发现这是一艘来自尤卡坦的玛雅贸易独木舟，船上载着穿着考究的玛雅人和丰富的货物，包括陶瓷、棉织品、黄石斧、镶有燧石的战棍、铜斧和铃铛以及可可。
Also among the cargo were a small number of women and children, probably destined to be sold as slaves, as were a number of the rowers.	货物中也有可能注定要作为奴隶被贩卖的少量妇女和儿童，还有一些桨手。
The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly Maya captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way.	欧洲人从货物中掠夺走他们感兴趣的任何东西，并抓住了年迈的玛雅船长作为翻译；之后，独木舟被允许继续航行。
This was the first recorded contact between Europeans and the Maya.	这是欧洲人和玛雅人之间第一次有记录的接触。
It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes – the first prophecies of bearded invaders sent by Kukulkan, the northern Maya feathered serpent god, were probably recorded around this time, and in due course passed into the books of Chilam Balam.	加勒比海陌生海盗的消息很可能是沿着玛雅的贸易路线传播的，由库库尔坎（玛雅北部的羽蛇神）发出的蓄须入侵者的第一个预言可能是在这个时候记录下来的，并在适当的时候传入了《契兰·巴兰书》中。
In 1511 the Spanish caravel Santa María de la Barca set sail along the Central American coast under the command of Pedro de Valdivia.	1511 年，在佩德罗·德·瓦尔迪维亚的指挥下，西班牙“Santa María de la Barca”号帆船沿着中美洲海岸启航。
The ship was sailing to Santo Domingo from Darién to inform the colonial authorities there of ongoing conflict between conquistadors Diego de Nicuesa and Vasco Nuñez de Balboa in Darién.	这艘船从达连驶向圣多明各，目的是通知当地的殖民当局征服者 Diego de Nicuesa 和 Vasco Nuñez de Balboa 之间正在发生的冲突。
The ship foundered upon a reef known as Las Víboras ("The Vipers") or, alternatively, Los Alacranes ("The Scorpions"), somewhere off Jamaica.	这艘船在撞到牙买加附近一个被称为 Las Víboras(“毒蛇”)或 Los Alacranes（“蝎子”）的暗礁之后沉没了。
There were just twenty survivors from the wreck, including Captain Valdivia, Gerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero.	沉船中只有 20 名幸存者，包括瓦尔迪维亚 船长、赫罗尼莫·德·阿基拉尔和冈萨洛·格雷罗。
They set themselves adrift in one of the ship's boats, with bad oars and no sail; after thirteen days during which half of the survivors died, they made landfall upon the coast of Yucatán.	他们登上了一艘船载小艇开始漂流，但这艘小艇桨坏了，也没有帆。十三天后，有一半的幸存者死亡，剩下的人在尤卡坦海岸登陆。
There they were seized by Halach Uinik, a Maya lord. Captain Vildivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast.	在那里，他们被玛雅领主 Halach Uinik 抓住。维尔迪维亚船长和他的四个同伴一起被当作祭品，他们的肉被摆在盛宴之上。
Aguilar and Guerrero were held prisoner and fattened for killing, together with five or six of their shipmates.	阿吉拉尔、格雷罗和他们的五、六名船员一起被关进监狱，并被养肥以便为屠宰做准备。
Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape their captors and fled to a neighbouring lord who was an enemy of Halach Uinik; he took them prisoner and kept them as slaves.	阿吉拉尔和格雷罗设法从他们的绑架者手中逃脱，并逃到了一个与 Halach Uinik 为敌的邻近领主那里；这个领主将他们囚禁起来，并把他们当作奴隶。
After a time, Gonzalo Guerrero was passed as a slave to the lord Nachan Can of Chetumal.	过了一段时间，冈萨洛·格雷罗成了切图马尔领主 Nachan Can 的奴隶。
Guerrero became completely Mayanised and served his new lord with such loyalty that he was married to one of Nachan Chan's daughters, Zazil Ha, by whom he had three children.	格雷罗完全变成了玛雅人，他忠诚地侍奉他的新领主，娶了 Nachan Chan 的一个女儿 Zazil Ha 为妻，并与她生了三个孩子。
The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem.	阿克拉并不是耶路撒冷的第一个希腊化据点。
Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts.	有资料表明，早期的堡垒，即托勒密时期的巴里斯，也曾占据过俯瞰圣殿的位置。
Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress.	尽管对巴里斯的确切位置仍然存在争议，但人们普遍认为它位于圣殿山以北，后来被安东尼亚要塞占据的地方。
The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt.	巴利斯王朝在公元前 2 世纪初落入安条克三世之手，在所有马卡比起义的记载中都没有出现。
Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege.	尽管有叙述说阿克拉是在极短的时间内建成的，但它仍然足够强大，足以经受长时间的围攻。
These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure.	这些因素，加上巴里斯本身被称为阿克拉，导致一些人认为巴里斯和阿克拉实际上是同一个体系。
Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case.	虽然《马加比一书》和约瑟夫斯似乎都将阿克拉描述为一个新的建筑，但事实可能并非如此。
Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the "impious or wicked" had "remained" rather than "dwelt" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.	《犹太古史》12:253 可翻译为“不虔诚或邪恶的人”“留在”而不是“住在”城堡里的意思，这样便可以认为阿克拉在起义前就已经矗立于此，只有马其顿的驻军是新的。
Koen Decoster proposes that Josephus wrote of "a citadel in the lower part of the city" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace.	柯恩·德科斯特认为，约瑟夫斯笔下的“城市下部的城堡”是写给那些熟悉公元 1 世纪的耶路撒冷的读者：这座城市确实有两个城堡：安东尼亚要塞和希律王宫。
As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, "a citadel in the lower city" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it.	由于约瑟夫斯的罗马耶路撒冷已经扩大到更高的西部山丘，“位于城市下层的城堡”可能是指位于泰罗边谷东部的任何事物，包括位于圣殿北部的安东尼亚，它确实高于圣殿并支配着它。
In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.	在他看来，这一定是约瑟夫斯在写下阿克拉时想到的地方。
Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center.	北部地点的反对者驳斥说，这一地点未能获得历史资料的支持，而且这将使阿克拉远离耶路撒冷的人口中心。
Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels, it was not meant as a defence against external threat, but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role incompatible with a proposed northern location.	与其前身和后继者的城堡不同，它并不是为了抵御外部威胁，而是为了监管这座城市的犹太人居住区，这一作用与提议中的北部位置不符。
The available sources do indicate the Acra stood south of the temple, and because 1 Maccabees is a contemporaneous account of the Maccabean revolt, its account of the Acra (1:35–38) is considered the most reliable.	现有资料确实表明阿克拉位于圣殿的南面，因为《马加比一书》是对马加比起义的同时代记述，它对阿克拉的记述 (1:35-38) 被认为是最可靠的。
Josephus provides an unlikely account of the razing of a hill on which the Acra had stood, yet his description of the end of the Great Revolt (70 CE) provides additional evidence for it being located south of the Temple Mount:	约瑟夫斯提供了一个关于夷平阿克拉曾经所在山丘不太可能的叙述，但他对大起义结束（公元 70 年）的描述为它位于圣殿山以南的事实提供了额外的证据。
...but on the next day they set fire to the repository of the archives, to Acra, to the council-house, and to the place called Ophlas; at which time the fire proceeded as far as the palace of queen Helena, which was in the middle of Acra;	...但在第二天，他们放火烧了档案室、阿克拉、议事厅和一个叫 Ophlas 的地方；当时，大火一直蔓延到海伦娜女王的宫殿，那是在阿克拉的中心。
— Flavius Josephus, The Wars of the Jews 6:354	— 弗拉维奥·约瑟夫斯，《犹太人的战争》6:354
As the other buildings mentioned in the account all stood to the south in the Lower City, this also places the Acra there.	由于记载中提到的其他建筑都位于城市下层的南面，这也将阿克拉放在了那里。
This account attests to the persistence of the name "Acra" in this part of Jerusalem many years after Hellenistic rule ended and its citadels had been overthrown, and it can also be seen as referring not to a distinct building but rather to an entire region of the city.	这段记载证明了在希腊统治结束和城堡被推翻多年后，“阿克拉”这个名字在耶路撒冷的这一地区仍然存在，当然，可以认为它指的不是一个独特的建筑，而是城市的整个区域。
Indeed, several clauses in 1 Maccabees may be read as making a similar point:	事实上，《马加比一书》中的几个段落可以被理解为表达了类似的观点：

On its release, reviewer Anne Rubenstein praised Love and Rockets X for expanding the "aesthetic possibilities of graphic narrative"; she recommended it as a starting point for new Love and Rockets readers daunted by the complexity of the earlier stories, and called it "as essential as the rest of the Hernandez canon".	在发行时，评论家 Anne Rubenstein 称赞“爱与火箭 X”拓展了“图形叙事的美学可能性”；她建议将其作为新的“爱与火箭”读者的起点，因为他们对早期故事的复杂性感到望而却步，并称其“与 Hernadez 的其余作品一样重要”。
Comics critic R. Fiore placed Love and Rockets X 7th on his list of best English non-strip comics of the 1990s.	漫画评论家 R. Fiore 将“爱与火箭 X”排在 20 世纪 90 年代最佳英文非连载漫画榜单中的第 7 位。
He calls it "a comics equivalent of a Victor Hugo-style social novel" and praises Hernandez for successfully interweaving so many of the quasi-isolated ethnic social milieus of Los Angeles into one narrative, though he found weakness in Hernandez's grasp of their various speech patterns and suggested actual South Americans would have been more appropriate to the real political background than the fictional Palomarians.	他称其为“一部相当于维克多雨果式的社会小说的漫画”，并称赞 Hernandez 成功地将洛杉矶如此之多的准孤立种族社会环境交织在一起进行叙述，尽管他发现 Hernandez 对他们的各种语言模式和把握存在弱点，并指出真正的南美人会比虚构的帕洛利亚人更适合真实的政治背景。
Reviewer Tom Knapp considered the work "confusing" and "one of the low points" in the Love and Rockets series.	评论家 Tom Knapp 认为这部作品“令人困惑”，是《爱与火箭》系列的低谷之一。
Douglas Wolk called Love and Rockets X "the prime example of Gilbert's fascinations as a storyteller". F. Vance Neill saw it as an early example of Hernandez's concern with "the values of trust, loyalty, honesty, and community" and "the consequences of failing to adhere to these values" that he explored later in works such as Speak of the Devil (2008) and The Troublemakers (2009).	Douglas Wolk 称“爱与火箭 X”是“Gilbert 热衷于讲故事的典型例子”。F. Vance Neill 认为这是 Hernandez 关注“信任、忠诚和社区价值观”以及“未能遵守这些价值观的后果”的早期例子，他后来在“恶魔讲述” (2008) 和“麻烦制造者” (2009) 中探讨了这个问题。
The story's Los Angeles setting anticipated that of Hernandez's post-Palomar stories featuring Luba and her family.	这个故事的洛杉矶背景预示着 Hernandez 在帕洛玛之后以 Luba 和她的家庭为主角的故事。

It was believed as late as 2002 that Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (NSML) was related to neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen syndrome).	直到 2002 年，人们还认为 Noonan 多斑痣综合征 (NSML) 与 I 型神经纤维瘤病（von Recklinghausen 综合征）有关。
In fact, since both ICD9 and ICD10 lack a specific diagnosis code for NSML, the diagnosis code for NF1 is still sometimes used for diagnostic purposes, although it has been shown that the gene is not linked to the NF1 locus.	事实上，由于 ICD9 和 ICD10 都缺乏 NSML 的具体诊断代码，因此有时仍然使用 NF1 的诊断代码进行诊断，尽管已经证明该基因与 NF1 基因座没有联系。

Described as a "dapper young man with a moustache waxed into long points", he made for a "dynamic figure with a penetrating voice", and was noted for riding his Douglas motorcycle through the 1920s and 30s in his khaki overalls as he traveled between his professional practice, teaching duties and home life.	被描绘为“蓄着长胡须的精致青年”的他塑造了一种“声音犀利且活力十足的人物形象”，他游走在专业实践、教学职责和家庭生活之间，以穿着卡其色工装并身骑道格拉斯摩托车穿越过 20 世纪 20 年代和 30 年代而闻名。

"Cygnet Committee" has been called Bowie's "first true masterpiece".	“小天鹅委员会”被称为鲍伊“第一首真正的杰作”。
Commonly regarded as the album track most indicative of the composer's future direction, its lead character is a messianic figure "who breaks down barriers for his younger followers, but finds that he has only provided them with the means to reject and destroy him".	他的主角是一个救世主式的人物，“他为他的年轻追随者打破了障碍，但却发现他只是为他们提供了拒绝和摧毁他的手段”，通常被认为是最能表明作曲家未来方向的专辑曲目。
Bowie himself described it at the time as a put down of hippies who seemed ready to follow any charismatic leader.	鲍伊本人当时将它描述为对似乎随时追随任何魅力领袖的嬉皮士的贬低。
Another track cited as foreshadowing themes to which Bowie would return in the 1970s, in this case the fracturing of personality, was "Janine", which featured the words "But if you took an axe to me, you'd kill another man not me at all".	另一首被认为预示着鲍伊在 20 世纪 70 年代回归的主题曲是“珍妮”，体现出人格分裂，其中含有歌词“但如果你拿斧头砍我，你会杀死另一个人而不是我”。
The Buddhism-influenced "Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud" was presented in a heavily expanded form compared to the original guitar-and-cello version on the B-side of the "Space Oddity" single; the album cut featured a 50-piece orchestra.	与“太空怪谈”单曲B面的原始吉他和大提琴版本相比，“来自 Freecloud 的野眼男孩”以极度膨胀的形式呈现；专辑剪辑呈现出一支50人的管弦乐队。
"Memory of a Free Festival" was Bowie's reminiscence of an arts festival he had organised in August 1969.	“自由节日的记忆”是鲍伊对他在1969 年 8 月组织的艺术节的追忆。
Its drawn-out fade/chorus ("The Sun Machine is coming down / And we're gonna have a party") was compared to The Beatles' "Hey Jude"; the song has also been interpreted as a derisive comment on the counterculture it was ostensibly celebrating.	它拖长的淡化/副歌（“太阳就要落下 / 派对即将开始”）被比作披头士的“嘿，朱迪”；这首歌也被解读为对它表面上所庆祝的反主流文化的嘲讽。
The background vocals for the crowd finale featured Bob Harris, his wife Sue, Tony Woollcott and Marc Bolan among other people.	尾声为 Bob Harris、他的妻子 Sue、Tony Woollcott 和 Marc Bolan 等人在人群中的背景式演唱。
In 1970 Bowie cut the tune in half for the A- and B-sides of a more rock-oriented version featuring the band that would accompany him on The Man Who Sold the World later that year: Mick Ronson, Tony Visconti and Mick Woodmansey – an embryonic form of Ziggy Stardust's Spiders From Mars.	1970 年，鲍伊将这首曲子一分为二，作为更注重摇滚的版本的 A 面和 B 面，这支乐队将在同年晚些时候为他的“出卖世界的人”伴奏：Mick Ronson、Tony Visconti 和 Mick Woodmansey - 来自火星的 Ziggy Stardust 的雏形。
NY 215 began at a three-way intersection with NY 360 east of the hamlet of Morton in the town of Hamlin.	NY 215 始于 Hamlin 镇 Morton 村以东与 NY 360 的一个三岔路口。
NY 360 turned off Redman Road here to follow Morton Road west to the hamlet of Morton while NY 215 headed north on Redman Road.	NY 360 在这里转出 Redman 路，沿着 Morton 路到达 Morton 村，而NY 215 则沿着 Redman 路向北。
It passed by open, cultivated fields and small pockets of residences as it proceeded through rural northwestern Monroe County.	在穿过 Monroe 县西北部农村时，会经过开阔的耕地和小片的住宅。
After 1.5 miles (2.4 km), NY 215 intersected Moscow Road, a local highway connecting NY 215 to the then-western end of the Lake Ontario State Parkway.	1.5 英里（2.4 公里）后，NY 215 与莫斯科路交汇，这是一条连接 NY 215 和当时安大略湖州立公园路西端的地方公路。
North of Moscow Road, the fields on the highway's east side slowly gave way to forested areas as the route approached Hamlin Beach State Park and intersected Cook Road.	在莫斯科路以北，随着路线接近 Hamlin Beach 州立公园并与 Cook 路交汇，公路东侧的田地逐渐让位给森林地带。
The route terminated 500 feet (150 m) north of Cook Road at the southern boundary of Hamlin Beach State Park.	这条路线在 Hamlin Beach 州立公园南部边界的 Cook 路以北 500 英尺（150 米）处终止。
The physical roadway continued into the park and to nearby Lake Ontario as a local highway.	实体道路继续进入公园，并作为地方公路通往附近的安大略湖。
The portion of Redman Road north of modern NY 360 in Hamlin was a state highway as early as 1920; however, it was not assigned a designation until the early 1940s, when it became NY 215.	Hamlin 现代化的 NY 360 以北的 Redman 路部分早在 1920 年就是一条州立公路；然而，直到 20 世纪 40 年代初，它才被指定为 NY 215。
At the time, it was the primary highway to and from Hamlin Beach State Park on the Lake Ontario shoreline, as no continuous east–west lakeside roadway existed at the time.	当时，它是往返于安大略湖岸边的 Hamlin Beach 州立公园的主要公路，因为当时没有连续的东西向湖滨公路。
This changed in the late 1940s and early 1950s following the construction of the Lake Ontario State Parkway, a lakeshore highway connecting the park to NY 261 in Greece.	在 20 世纪 40 年代末和 50 年代初，这种情况随着安大略湖州立公园路的建设而改变，这条湖滨公路连接公园和希腊的 NY 261。
The parkway began east of NY 215 at Moscow Road and provided a direct connection to Hamlin Beach State Park from Greece, and eventually Rochester.	这条公园路在莫斯科路的 NY 215 路以东开始，从希腊直接连接到 Harmlin Beach 州立公园，并最终连接到罗切斯特。
As a result, NY 215 became merely an alternate route to the park.	因此，NY 215 仅仅成为通往该公园的一条备用路线。
In the early 1970s, the Lake Ontario State Parkway was extended westward across Monroe and Orleans counties to Lakeside Beach State Park in Carlton.	在 20 世纪 70 年代初，安大略湖州立公园路向西延伸，穿过 Monroe 和 Orleans 县，到达 Carlton 的 Lakeside Beach 州立公园。
NY 215's connection to Hamlin Beach State Park was severed as part of the construction.	在建设中，NY 215 与 Harmlin Beach 州立公园的连接被切断。
As a result, the remaining portion of NY 215 from NY 360 to Cook Road lost its signed route status and was redesignated NY 941P, an unsigned reference route.	因此，NY 215 从 NY 360 到 Cook 路的剩余部分失去了标示路线地位，被重新指定为一条无标示的参考路线 NY941P。
The highway remained state maintained until 2007, when ownership and maintenance of it was transferred from the state of New York to Monroe County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.	直到 2007 年，这条公路一直由州政府维护，作为两级政府之间公路维护交换的一部分，该公路的所有权和维护从纽约州移交给 Monroe 县。
A bill (S4856, 2007) to enact the swap was introduced in the New York State Senate on April 23 and passed by both the Senate and the New York State Assembly on June 20.	4 月 23 日，纽约州参议院提出了一项关于交换的法案（S4856，2007），并在 6 月 20 日获得参议院和纽约州议会通过。
The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August 28. Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November 26, 2007. The former routing of NY 941P is now part of CR 236.	该法案于 8 月 28 日由州长 Eliot Sitzer 签署成为法律。根据法案条款，它在签署成为法律 90 天后生效；因此，维护交换于 2007 年 11 月 26 日正式进行。NY 941P 以前的路线现在成为 CR 236 的一部分。
Like all species in the genus Lactarius, L. subflammeus is mycorrhizal, forming mutualistic associations with trees.	与乳菇属的所有物种一样，L.subflammeus 是菌根，与树木形成共生关系。
The fungus and the plant forms structures called ectomycorrhizae, a specialized sheath of hyphae on the surface of the root from which hyphae extend into the soil and into the outer cortical cells of the root.	真菌和植物形成叫做外生菌根的结构，这是根部表面上的一种专门的菌丝鞘，菌丝从这里延伸到土壤中，进入根部的外部皮质细胞。
The fruit bodies of L. subflammeus grow scattered to grouped under conifers or in mixed conifer-hardwood forests near pine and spruce, from August to December.	从 8 月到 12 月，L.subflammeus 的子实体分散生长在针叶树下或松树和云杉附近的针叶-硬木混交林中。
The fungus is widely distributed in the Pacific Northwest, where it is very common in conifer forests.	该真菌广泛分布在西北太平洋地区，在针叶林中很常见。
The habitat of the type location was coastal sand dunes under pine.	生境位置类型为松树下的沿海沙丘。
States from which the fungus has been collected include Washington, Idaho, Oregon, California, and Colorado.	采集到这种真菌的州包括华盛顿、爱达荷、俄勒冈、加利福利亚和科罗拉多。
The mushroom's range extends north into Canada, where it has been found near Victoria, British Columbia in coastal forests dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).	这种蘑菇的分布范围向北延伸到加拿大，在不列颠哥伦比亚省维多利亚附近以花旗松 (Pseudotsuga menziesii) 为主的沿海森林中发现了它的身影。
Brooks left St.	Brooks 离开了 St.
Ives and moved to Paris.	lves 并搬到巴黎。
Poor young painters such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse were creating new art in the Bohemian districts of Montparnasse and Montmartre.	贫穷的年轻画家如巴勃罗毕加索和亨利马蒂斯正在蒙巴纳斯和蒙马特的波西米亚区创造新艺术。
In contrast, Brooks took an apartment in the fashionable 16th arrondissement, mingled in elite social circles, and painted portraits of wealthy and titled women.	相比之下，布鲁克斯在时尚的第 16 区租了一套公寓，混迹于精英社交圈，并为有爵位的富有女性绘制肖像。
These included her current lover, the Princess de Polignac.	这些人中包括她的现任情人 de Polignac 公主。
In 1910 Brooks had her first solo show at the prestigious Gallery Durand-Ruel, displaying thirteen paintings, almost all of women or young girls.	1910 年，布鲁克斯在著名的 Durand-Ruel 画廊举办了她的首场个人展，展出了 13 幅几乎都为妇女或年轻女孩的画作。
Some were portraits; others showed anonymous models in interior scenes or against tonal backgrounds, often with pensive or withdrawn expressions.	有些是肖像画；其他的则是在室内场景或色调背景下的无名模特，她们往往带着沉思或孤僻的表情。
The paintings were generally naturalistic, showing an attentive eye for the details of Belle Époque fashion, with parasols, veils, and elaborate bonnets on display.	这些画作通常透露出自然主义，展现出对美好年代时尚细节的关注，展示了遮阳伞、面纱和精致的帽子。
Brooks included two nude studies in this first exhibition—a provocative choice for a woman artist in 1910.	布鲁克斯的首场展览中包含两幅裸体研究，这对 1910 年的女艺术家来说是一种挑衅的选择。
In The Red Jacket, a young woman stands in front of a large folding screen, wearing only a small open jacket, with her hands behind her back.	在“红夹克”中，一名年轻女子站在一块大折叠屏风前，只穿着一件敞开的小外套，双手背在身后。
She is so frail, and her downcast face looks so forlorn that one contemporary reviewer referred to her as a consumptive; Brooks described her simply as "a poor girl who was cold".	她如此虚弱，她低垂的脸看起来如此悲凉，以至于一位当代评论家称她是痨病患者；布鲁克斯对她的描述只是“一个寒冷的可怜女孩”。
The other, White Azaleas, is a more sexually charged nude study of a woman reclining on a couch.	在另一幅“白色杜鹃花”中，则对斜倚沙发的一名女子进行了更具性感色彩的裸体研究。
Contemporary reviews compared it to Francisco de Goya's La maja desnuda and Édouard Manet's Olympia.	当代评论将其与弗朗西斯科戈雅的“裸体的马哈”和爱德华马奈的“奥林匹亚”相提并论。
Unlike the women in those paintings, the subject of White Azaleas looks away from the viewer; in the background above her is a series of Japanese prints which Brooks loved.	与这些画中的女人不同，“白色杜鹃花”的对象把目光从观众身上移开；她上方的背景是布鲁克斯喜欢的一系列日本版画。
The exhibition established Brooks' reputation as an artist.	这次展览奠定了布鲁克斯作为艺术家的声誉。
Reviews were effusive, and the poet Robert de Montesquiou wrote an appreciation calling her "the thief of souls." The restrained, almost monochromatic decor of her home also attracted attention; she was often asked to give advice on interior design, and sometimes did, though she did not relish the role of decorator.	人们对她赞不绝口，诗人罗贝尔德孟德斯鸠写了一篇评论，称她是“灵魂窃贼”。她家几乎是单色的朴素装饰也吸引了人们的注意；经常有人要她提供室内设计方面的建议，虽然有时她会这样做，但她并不喜欢装饰师的角色。
Brooks became increasingly disillusioned with Parisian high society, finding the conversation dull, and feeling that people were whispering about her.	布鲁克斯对巴黎上流社会越来越失望，发现谈吐乏味，觉得充满流言蜚语。
Despite her artistic success, she described herself as a lapidée—literally, a victim of stoning.	尽管她在艺术上取得了成功，但她仍将自己描述为 lapidée — 字面意思就是石刑的受害者。
In 1909 Brooks met Gabriele D'Annunzio, an Italian writer and politician who had come to France to escape his debts.	1909 年，布鲁克斯遇到了一位为了躲债来到法国的意大利作家和政治家加布里埃尔邓南遮。
She saw him as a martyred artist, another lapidé; he wrote poems based on her works and called her "the most profound and wise orchestrator of grays in modern painting".	她视他为一名殉道的艺术家，另一个 lapidé；他根据她的作品写诗，称她为“现代绘画中最深刻、最睿智的灰色协调者”。
Astrocytes form gap junctions and are closely associated with the vasculature and its basal lamina in the adult SVZ and subsequently in the RMS.	星形胶质细胞形成间隙连接，并与成体 SVZ 以及后续 RMS 中的血管及其基底层密切相关。
They may serve as an interface to modulate influences of endothelial and circulation-derived factors as well as the availability of cytokines and growth factors in this system.	它们可能作为一个接口来调节内皮和循环源性因素的影响以及该系统中细胞因子和生长因子的可用性。
In addition, astrocytes derived from the neurogenic hippocampus and SVZ, but not from the non-neurogenic spinal cord, promote proliferation and neuronal fate commitment of multipotent adult neural stem cells in culture, suggesting a role in the RMS.	此外，来自神经源性海马和 SVZ 的星形胶质细胞，而不是来自非神经源性脊髓的星形胶质细胞，在培养中能促进多能成体神经干细胞的增殖和神经元命运决定，表明了它在 RMS 中的作用。
Astrocytes express a number of secreted and membrane-attached factors both in vitro and in vivo that are known to regulate proliferation and fate specification of adult neural precursors as well as neuronal migration, maturation, and synapse formation.	星形胶质细胞在体外和体内都表达一些分泌和膜附着的因子，这些因子已知可调节成体神经前体的增殖和命运规范，以及神经元迁移、成熟和突触的形成。
In the adult SVZ, astrocytes express Robo receptors and regulate the rapid migration of SLIT1-expressing neuroblasts through the RMS.	在成体 SVZ 中，星形胶质细胞表达 Robo 受体并调节表达 SLIT1 的神经母细胞通过 RMS 的快速迁移。
Additionally, it has been proposed that the neuroblasts themselves play a role in modulating the astrocytes through Slit-Robo interactions.	此外，有人提出，神经母细胞本身通过 Slit-Robo 相互作用在调节星形胶质细胞方面起作用。
In the absence of Slit, astrocytic processes do not align correctly, or create the "tubes", instead running across the migrating neurons.	在没有 Slit 的情况下，星形胶质细胞过程不能正确对齐，也不能形成“管道”，而是穿过迁移的神经元。
Adult SVZ astrocytes also appear to release glutamate to regulate the survival of neuroblasts.	成体 SVZ 星形胶质细胞似乎也释放谷氨酸来调节神经母细胞的生存。
Unique to the adult SVZ, ependymal cells lining the ventricular wall are in close association with neural precursors and their progeny, acting like a shield to protect the "neurogenic niche", a zone in which stem cells are retained after embryonic development for the production of new cells of the nervous system.	成体 SVZ 的独特之处在于，心室壁内的室管膜细胞与神经前体及其后代密切相关，就像是一个保护“神经原性生态位”的盾牌，该区域的干细胞在胚胎发育后被保留下来，用于制造神经系统的新细胞。
Ependymal cells actively regulate neuronal fate specification of adult neural precursors through release of Noggin.	室管膜细胞通过释放 Noggin 积极调节成体神经前体的神经元命运规范。
Beating of the cilia of ependymal cells appears to set up concentration gradients of guidance molecules, such as cytokines TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), to direct migration of neuroblasts, such as in the RMS.	室管膜细胞的纤毛跳动似乎建立了引导分子的浓度梯度，如神经因子TNF-α（肿瘤坏死因子）和 IGF-1（胰岛素样生长因子），以指导 RMS 等中的神经母细胞迁移 。
Microglia also actively regulate adult neurogenesis.	小胶质细胞也积极调节成体神经发生。
Under basal conditions, apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from the niche by unactivated microglia in the adult SGZ.	在基础条件下，成体 SGZ 中未激活的小胶质细胞会迅速吞噬新生神经元的凋亡尸体。
Under inflammatory conditions, reactivated microglia can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of adult neurogenesis, depending on the balance between secreted molecules with pro- and anti-inflammatory action.	在炎症条件下，重新激活的小胶质细胞可以对成体神经发生的不同方面产生有益和有害的影响，具体取决于具有促炎和抗炎作用的分泌分子的平衡。
In one study, the activation of microglia and recruitment of T cells were suggested to be required for enriched environment-induced SGZ neurogenesis, suggesting a possible role in the RMS.	在一项研究中，小胶质细胞激活和 T 细胞募集表明对丰富的环境诱导的 SGZ 神经发生必不可少，这说明在 RMS 中可能有作用。
Cells in the RMS are believed to move by "chain migration".	RMS 中的细胞被认为是通过“链式迁移”移动的。
These neuroblasts are connected by membrane specializations including gap junctions and adherens junctions, moving along each other towards the olfactory bulb through glial tubes.	这些神经母细胞通过膜特化连接，包括间隙连接和粘附连接，通过胶质管彼此朝嗅球移动。
The pathway and mechanisms behind this movement are a ventriculo-olfactory neurogenic system (VONS), a glial framework, and a chemotaxic cell signalling system.	这种运动背后的途径和机制是脑室-嗅觉神经源系统 (VONS)、胶质框架和趋化细胞信号传导系统。
The olfactory system is made up in part of the RMS which stretches from the subventricular zone in the wall of the lateral ventricle, through the basal forebrain, to the olfactory bulb (OB).	嗅觉系统部分由 RMS 组成，RMS 从侧脑室壁的脑室下区延伸到基底前脑，再到嗅球 (OB)。
VONS is the name given to this pathway, and it consists of the subventricular zone, the RMS, the olfactory tract and the olfactory bulb.	VONS 是这个通路的名称，它由脑室下区、RMS、嗅道和嗅球组成。
On January 21, 2007, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Nadi, Fiji identified a tropical depression, which was given the number 08F, about 435 km (270 mi) west-northwest of Savai'i island in Samoa.	2007 年 1 月 21 日，斐济纳迪的区域专业气象中心在萨摩亚萨瓦伊岛西北偏西约 435 公里（270 英里）处发现一个热带低气压，其编号为08F。
The depression slowly traveled towards the east-southeast for several days as the overall structure of the storm fluctuated due to diurnal variations and strong wind shear.	该气压在几天内缓慢地向东-东南方向移动，因为风暴的整体结构因昼夜变化和强风切变而波动。
Around 1700 UTC on January 22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the depression.	1 月 22 日 UTC 时间 17 时左右，联合台风警报中心 (JTWC) 对该低气压发布了热带气旋形成警报。
The system developed a large banding feature in the northern portion of the circulation and deep convection formed around the center of circulation.	该系统在环流北部形成一处大型带状特征，环流中心周围形成深层对流。
The depression had moved into an area of weak to moderate wind shear with favorable diffulence aloft.	该低气压已进入一个弱到中等风切变区域，高处扩散良好。
Later that day, gale warnings were issued for the northeastern quadrant of the system.	当天晚些时候，该系统的东北部地区发布大风警报。
Tropical Depression 08F continued to develop as an anticyclone developed above the system, enhancing the environment around it.	热带低气压 08F 继续发展，因为该系统上方一个反气旋加强了它周围的环境。
A mid-latitude trough located north of the depression was steering it towards the east.	位于低气压北部的一个中纬槽将其引向东部。
Early on January 24, the system became better organized and strengthened into a cyclone at 0600 UTC.	1 月 24 日早些时候，该系统变得更有组织性，并在 UTC 时间 6 时加强成气旋。
The storm, which was named Arthur by the RSMC Nadi, began to undergo rapid intensification as the structure improved significantly.	这个被 RSMC Nadi 命名为亚瑟的风暴，随着结构明显改善而开始迅速增强。
Deep convection developed around the center with strong outflow towards the north.	中心周围形成了深层对流，向北流出强烈。
Several hours after becoming a cyclone, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Cyclone 09P as it traveled quickly towards the east-southeast.	在成为气旋后的几个小时，由于热带气旋 09P 迅速向东南方移动，JTWC 对它发布了第一个警告。
The quick movement was due to the influences of subtropical ridge to the north and a trough to the south.	这种快速移动是由于北部的副热带脊和南部的低谷影响。
Later that day, a banding eye feature began to develop as the storm intensified into a Category 2 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale.	当天晚些时候，随着风暴加强为澳大利亚强度等级为 2 类的气旋，开始形成带状眼特征。
At 1800 UTC, the JTWC assessed Arthur to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 1-minute winds), the equivalent of a minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.	在 UTC 时间 18 时，JTWC 评估亚瑟达到了它的峰值强度，风速为 120 公里/小时（1 分钟 75 英里的风速），相当于 Saffir-Simpson 飓风等级中的最小 1 类飓风。
Early on January 25, Arthur reached its peak intensity with winds of 110 km/h (70 mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 975 hPa (mbar) while located about 635 km (350 mi) north-northwest of Rarotonga.	1 月 25 日早些时候，在 Rarotonga 西北方向约 635 公里（350 英里）处，亚瑟达到峰值强度，风速为 110 公里/小时（10 分钟 70 英里的风速），最低气压为 975 hPa (mbar)。
Shortly after peaking in intensity, Arthur began to undergo an extratropical transition and rapidly deteriorated due to strong wind shear.	在强度达到顶峰后不久，亚瑟开始经历外热带的转变，并由于强风切变而迅速恶化。
The storm also began to merge with a low-level frontal boundary associated with the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Zita.	风暴也开始与与热带气旋 Zita 残余势力有关的低层锋面边界合并。
The strong shear left the center of circulation partially exposed, with deep convection persisting in only the southeastern quadrant.	强烈的切变使得环流中心部分暴露，只有东南方向的深层对流持续存在。
In addition to the shear, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken further.	除了切变之外，干燥空气开始进入系统，导致它进一步减弱。
The olm is a symbol of Slovenian natural heritage.	人鱼是斯洛文尼亚自然遗产的一种象征。
The enthusiasm of scientists and the broader public about this inhabitant of Slovenian caves is still strong 300 years after its discovery.	在它被发现的 300 年后，科学家和广大公众对斯洛文尼亚洞穴这一栖息动物的热情仍然很强烈。
Postojna Cave is one of the birthplaces of speleobiology due to the olm and other rare cave inhabitants, such as the blind cave beetle.	由于人鱼和盲螈等其他罕见的洞穴栖息动物，波斯托伊纳洞穴成为洞穴生物学的诞生地之一。
The image of the olm contributes significantly to the fame of Postojna Cave, which Slovenia successfully utilizes for the promotion of ecotourism in Postojna and other parts of Slovenian karst.	人鱼形象极大促进了波斯托伊纳洞穴的名气，斯洛文尼亚成功地利用它来促进波斯托伊纳和斯洛文尼亚其他喀斯特地区的生态旅游。
Tours of Postojna Cave also include a tour around the speleobiological station – the Proteus vivarium, showing different aspects of the cave environment.	波斯托伊纳洞穴旅游还包括参观洞穴生物学站 - Proteus 动物园，展示洞穴环境的不同方面。
The olm was also depicted on one of the Slovenian tolar coins, and was the namesake of Proteus, the oldest Slovenian popular science magazine, first published in 1933.	人鱼也被描绘在斯洛文尼亚的一枚托拉尔硬币上，并且与斯洛文尼亚最古老的科普杂志，于 1933 年首次出版的《Proteus》同名。
Heavy rains from the storm affected the Philippines, causing flooding that forced 3,500 people to evacuate their houses.	风暴带来的大雨影响了菲律宾，引发洪水，迫使 3,500 人撤离家园。
This occurred after a month of heavy rainfall from several tropical cyclones in July.	这发生在七月份几个热带气旋带来一个月的强降雨之后。

Two government helicopters were sent shortly thereafter, assessing the severity of damage, evacuating residents, and delivering food.	此后不久派出了两架政府直升机，评估损失严重程度，疏散居民，并运送食物。
Bjelke-Petersen later expressed anger at the federal government for having increased the threshold for disaster relief before raising loans, and also stated that the Federal Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin, had no right to accompany him on his visit to northern Queensland, only offering to discuss an offer provided that the federal government was willing to provide financial assistance.	Bjelke-Petersen 后来对联邦政府在筹款前提高救灾门槛表示愤怒，还表示联邦初级产业部长 John Kerin 无权陪同他访问昆士兰北部，只提出讨论提议，前提是联邦政府愿意提供财政援助。
Approximately 500 volunteers for the SES were deployed the same day, reinstating electrical and other essential services, evacuating regional citizens, delivering bread to numerous towns, and sending 700 tarpaulins to shield roofless houses.	同一天出动了大约 500 名 SES 志愿者，恢复了电力和其他基本服务，疏散了当地民众，向许多城镇运送面包，并送去了 700 张防水油布用以遮挡没有屋顶的房屋。
Rescue and relief work was hindered by high traffic on telephone networks, forcing Telecom to cease calls between Townsville and Ingham.	电话网络的流量高企阻碍了抢险救灾工作，迫使电信公司停止了汤斯维尔和英厄姆之间的通信。
Emergency crews of the government's Department of Social Security (DSS) visited locations throughout the region, receiving damage claims, requests for monetary aid, and filings for unemployment benefits.	政府社会保障部 (DSS) 的应急人员访问了整个地区的各个地点，接受损失索赔、经济援助请求和失业福利申请。

The first $10 million in aid from the state government, paid by the federal government, was supplied the same day.	由联邦政府支付的州政府第一笔 1000 万美元的援助款，也在同一天提供。
Meanwhile, the SES continued its cleanup efforts, removing debris and repairing structures.	同时，SES 继续进行清理工作，清除残骸并修复结构。
Looters took advantage of confusion in the days following the cyclone, striking residences throughout Innisfail.	在气旋过后的几天里，掠夺者利用混乱局面袭击了整个 Innisfail 的住宅。
By the end of the day, 2200 tarpaulins had been distributed; however, the previously-smooth relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms in Cairns.	到当天结束时，分发了 2200 张防水油布；然而，先前顺利的救援工作因 Cairns 的雷暴而受阻。
The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) was subject to scrutiny in the aftermath of Winifred, and was criticized for its lack of advance warning.	在发生 Winifred 之后气象局 (BoM) 受到审查，并因其缺乏预警而受到批评。
Advices and warnings were received by regional television and radio stations up to 15 minutes late following issuance.	直到发布后 15 分钟，地区电视台和广播电台才收到通知和警告。
Winifred's sudden and unexpected turn was little-anticipated by BoM meteorologists, with employees unable to verify the cyclone's centre from the Cairns radar until only about 9:30 a.m. on 1 February, with radar error of up to 44 km (27 mi) observed.	Winifred 出现出乎意料的突然转变，让 BoM 的气象学家始料未及，直到 2 月 1 日上午 9:30，员工才从 Cairns 的雷达上确认气旋中心，并观察到雷达误差高达 44 公里（27 英里）。
However, a Flash Tropical Cyclone Advice was immediately issued shortly thereafter, reaching media outlets near noon that day.	然而，此后不久就立即发布了闪电热带气旋通知，在当天中午时分透露给媒体。
Media outlets went suggested the creation of a new Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Townsville as a result, but the suggestion was dismissed, with a centre already established in Brisbane.	媒体建议在汤斯维尔建立新的热带气旋预警中心 (TCWC)，但这个建议被驳回，因为布里斯班已建立一处中心。
A spokesman for the SES stated that no warning was given by the BoM at 9 a.m., with the storm's alarming approach; the Service had initially been anticipating the storm's recurvature out to sea, only to receive a flash warning hours later.	SES 的一位发言人表示，上午 9 时风暴令人震惊的逼近，但 BoM 没有发出任何警告；服务局最初预计风暴会再次卷入大海，几小时后才受到闪光警告。

Most of the skeleton is preserved, the bones still attached to each other in their original anatomical position.	大部分骨架保留了下来，骨头仍然按照原来的解剖位置彼此连接。
The tail, hind feet, and hind portion of the pelvis had eroded away before the mummy was discovered.	在木乃伊被发现之前，尾巴、后脚和骨盆的后部已经腐蚀。
Fossils often become flattened during fossilization, but AMNH 5060 is preserved three-dimensionally, without significant deformation.	化石在化石化过程中往往会变平，但 AMNH 5060 进行了三维保存，没有明显变形。
The specimen was found lying on its back, with head and neck twisted upwards, backwards, and to the right side of the body.	该标本被发现时呈仰卧，头和脖子向上、向后，扭向身体右侧。
Both knees are drawn forwards, while the forelimbs are outstretched.	双膝前拉，前肢伸出。
Although the tail curves upwards and forwards over the body in many dinosaur skeletons, it was probably straight in the mummy as movement would have been restricted by ossified tendons.	在许多恐龙骨架中，虽然尾巴向上和向前弯曲，但在这具木乃伊中它可能是笔直的，因为活动会受到骨化肌腱的限制。
Almost two-thirds of the total skin area is preserved, often with excellent preservation.	几乎三分之二的皮肤总面积得以保存，通常保存完好。
The skin impressions are pressed tightly onto the bones, and are partially drawn into the body in between the bones.	皮肤印痕紧压在骨头上，部分被拉到骨头之间的身体里。
When discovered, skin impressions probably encased the whole skeleton, but were partially destroyed while freeing it from the surrounding rocks.	在被发现时，皮肤印痕可能包裹了整个骨架，但在从周围的岩石中挖出时遭到部分破坏。
Skin impressions are preserved on the forelimbs, neck and throat, and the chest, as well as on the right side of the trunk.	前肢、颈部和喉咙、胸部以及躯干右侧保留了皮肤印痕。
As well as the skin impressions, Sternberg noted the preservation of muscle impressions.	除了皮肤印痕，Sternberg 还注意到保存的肌肉印痕。
In 2007, paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter suggested that even impressions of inner organs are possibly preserved; this cannot be evaluated without detailed computer tomography and x-ray analyses.	2007 年，古生物学家 Kenneth Carpenter 提出，即便内脏器官印痕也可能保存下来；如果没有详细的计算机断层扫描和 x 射线分析，就无法对其进行评估。
The skin was thin and delicate in relation to the size of the animal.	与动物的体型相比，皮肤又薄又脆弱。
As typical for dinosaurs, the skin consisted of non-overlapping scales called tubercles.	对于恐龙，皮肤通常由称为结节的非重叠鳞片组成。
Two sorts of tubercles can be distinguished.	可以区分两种结节。
Evenly distributed on the skin were the "ground tubercles", which were small, rounded scales between 1 and 3 mm (0.039 and 0.118 in) in diameter.	均匀分布在皮肤上的是“基底结节”，它们是直径 1 到 3 毫米（0.039 到 0.118 英寸）之间的圆形小鳞片。
The larger "pavement tubercles", less than 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter, were pentagonal in shape, raised relative to the ground tubercles, and arranged in irregular clusters interrupting the surface formed by the lower ground tubercles.	较大的“铺面结节”直径小于 5 毫米（0.20 英寸），呈五边形，相对于基底结节呈凸起状，并以不规则的簇状排列，阻断了下部基底结节形成的表面。
These clusters consisted of between twenty and several hundred individual pavement tubercles, and were bordered by intermediate tubercles which mediated in size and shape between ground and pavement tubercles.	这些簇由 20 到几百个单独的铺面结节组成，以中间结节为界，其大小和形状介于基底结节和铺面结节之间。
In the chest and abdominal region, clusters were small, oval in shape and arranged in irregular longitudinal lines.	胸部和腹部区域的簇很小，呈椭圆形并排列成不规则的纵向线。
They became larger towards the sides of the trunk, where they reached 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) in diameter; their shape became more irregular.	它们在躯干两侧变大，直径达到 5 至 10 厘米（2.0 至 3.9 英寸）；形状变得更加不规则。
A cold front's location is at the leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as the leading edge of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough.	冷锋位置在温度下降前缘，在等温线分析中显示为等温线梯度前缘，它通常位于尖锐的表面低压槽内。
Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in.	冷锋的移动速度可以达到暖锋的两倍，并且会产生更剧烈的天气变化，因为冷空气的密度比暖空气大，冷空气移动时会迅速抬升暖空气。
Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms.	冷锋通常伴随狭窄的阵雨和雷暴带。
On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at the leading edge of the cooler air mass.	在气象图上，冷锋的表面位置被标记为蓝色三角形/尖峰（吸气峰压）的符号，指向行进方向，位于较冷气团的前缘。
Warm fronts mark the position on the Earth's surface where a relatively warm body of air has displaced colder air.	暖锋标志着地球表面上相对温暖的气体取代较冷空气的位置。
The temperature increase is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lies within broader low pressure troughs than is the case with cold fronts.	温度上升位于等温线梯度的赤道边缘，并且位于比冷锋更宽的低压槽内。
Warm fronts move more slowly than do the cold fronts because cold air is denser, and harder to displace from the Earth's surface.	暖锋移动速度比冷锋慢，因为冷空气密度较大，更难从地球表面移开。
This causes temperature differences across warm fronts to be broader in scale.	这导致暖锋之间的温差规模更大。
The warm air mass overrides the cold air mass and temperature changes occur at higher altitudes before those at the surface.	暖气团覆盖冷气团，温度变化发生在高海拔地区，之后它们才到达表面。
Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly stratiform and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches.	暖锋前方的云层大多呈层状，随着暖锋临近，降雨量逐渐增加。
Fog can also occur preceding a warm front passage.	暖锋通过前也会出现大雾。
Clearing and warming is usually rapid after the passage of a warm front.	暖锋通过后，通常会迅速放晴和变暖。
If the warm air mass is unstable, mixing of the warm moist air will produce thunderstorms that are embedded among the stratiform clouds ahead of the front, and after frontal passage, thundershowers may continue.	如果暖气团不稳定，暖湿空气混合将产生雷暴，这些雷暴嵌入锋前方的层状云中，锋面通过后，雷阵雨可能会继续。
On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of half circles pointing in the direction of travel.	在气象图上，暖锋的表面位置用半圆红线标记，指向行进方向。
An occluded front is formed during the process of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front.	在气旋形成过程中，当冷锋超过暖锋时，就会形成锢囚锋。
The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology.	冷锋和暖锋自然而然地极向弯曲进入锢囚点，这在气象学上也被称为三相点。
It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold.	它位于尖锐的低压槽内，但边界后面的气团可以是暖气团或冷气团。
In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses.	在冷锢囚锋中，超越暖锋的气团比暖锋前面的冷空气更冷，并在这两个气团下犁过。
In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air.	在暖锢囚锋中，超越暖锋的气团不像暖锋前面的冷空气那样冷，而是骑在较冷的气团上，同时抬升暖空气。
A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass.	沿锢囚锋可以发现各种各样的天气，可能有雷暴，但其通过一般与气团干燥有关。
Though silvertip sharks are quite mobile, they exhibit fidelity to certain areas, with reports of territorial behavior.	虽然银鳍鲨行动灵活，但它们对某些区域表现出忠诚度，并有领土行为的报道。
They are usually encountered alone or in pairs.	它们通常单独或成对出现。
Small groups of adult females have been seen in deep water.	有人在深水域中曾看到过一小群成年雌性。
Individual silvertip sharks behave very aggressively towards one another, and many are heavily scarred.	个别银鳍鲨彼此的行为很有攻击性，许多银鳍鲨身上伤痕累累。
They are also reported to dominate Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and blacktip sharks (C.	据报道，在争夺食物时，它们还会支配同等体型的加拉帕戈斯鲨 (C. galapagensis) 和黑鳍鲨 (C.
limbatus) of equal size when competing for food.	limbatus)。
This shark sometimes forms mixed-species aggregations with grey reef sharks.	这种鲨鱼有时会与灰礁鲨形成混合物种聚集体。
Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against silvertip sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.	已经观察到纺綞鰤 (Elagatis bipinnulata) 与银鳍鲨摩擦，利用鲨鱼粗糙的皮肤刮掉寄生虫。
They sometimes follow marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in open water, and are themselves followed by pilot fish (Naucrates ductor).	它们有时会在开阔水域跟随宽吻海豚 (Tursiops sp.) 等海洋哺乳动物，领航鱼 (Naucrates ductor) 也会跟随它们。
Like the grey reef shark, the silvertip shark sometimes perform a stereotypical threat display if pursued by divers, warning that it is prepared to attack.	像灰礁鲨一样，银鳍鲨被潜水员追赶时有时会做出典型的威胁展示，警告它准备攻击。
The display begins with the shark accelerating away to a distance of 15 m (49 ft), before turning and charging towards the perceived threat.	展示开始时，银鳍鲨加速离开 15 米（49 英尺）远，然后转向并冲向所感知到的威胁。
At a distance of two body lengths, the shark brakes, turns broadside, drops its pectoral fins, gapes its jaws, lowers the posterior two-thirds of its body, and "shivers".	在两个体长的距离处，银鳍鲨刹住，转向宽侧，放下胸鳍，张开下巴，降低身体后补的三分之二，并“颤抖”。
The last two elements of this display are unique to this species; the "shivering" may serve to emphasize its white fin markings.	这种展示的最后两个元素系该物种独有；“颤抖”可能是为了强调其白色的鳍部标记。
If the diver persists, the shark may rapidly close in and slash with its upper teeth.	如果潜水员还坚持，鲨鱼可能会迅速靠近并用它的上牙劈砍。
The diet of the silvertip shark consists primarily of bony fishes, such as grouper, mackerel, tuna, escolars, lanternfish, flyingfish, wrasses, and soles.	银鳍鲨的食物主要包括硬骨鱼，如石斑鱼、鲭鱼、金枪鱼、河豚、油鱼、灯笼鱼、飞鱼、隆头鱼和鳎鱼。
Eagle rays, smaller sharks, and octopus are occasionally taken.	鹰鳐、小鲨鱼和章鱼偶尔也会被捕获。
Larger sharks tend to be more sluggish and take more benthic prey.	体型较大的鲨鱼往往更迟钝，猎捕更多的底栖猎物。
The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of flesh with violent twists and turns.	上下颚不同形状的齿状物能够让它们对付大型猎物，用猛烈的扭动来夹住和锯掉大块的肉。
Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food.	人们观察到银鳍鲨在其他物种的觅食鲨鱼群周围游动，偶尔会冲进去偷食。
This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.	这个物种经常接近船只，因为它们被某些人造的低频声音所吸引。
From the 1990s onward an increasing amount of literature on Canadian comics has appeared, in both official languages.	从 20 世纪 90 年代开始，越来越多关于加拿大漫画的文献以两种官方语言出现。
Books such as Guardians of the North (1992) and Invaders from the North (2006) appeared by comics historian John Bell, who became senior archivist at Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa.	漫画历史学家约翰贝尔出版了《北方的守护者》(1992) 和《北方入侵者》(2006) 等书籍，他成为加拿大渥太华图书馆和档案馆的高级档案管理员。

In 2007, Hartshead Sports College was placed on "special measures" after it failed to achieve its targets for General Certificate of Secondary Education results and was criticised by Ofsted for its teaching standard.	2007 年，Hartshead 体育学院因未能实现其普通中等教育证书成绩目标而受到“特殊措施”处理，并因其教学标准而受到 Ofsted 的批评。
The new academy opened in September 2008, a year ahead of schedule.	新学院于 2008 年 9 月开业，比计划提前一年。
It was named New Charter Academy (now Great Academy Ashton) after its sponsor, the New Charter Housing Trust.	它被命名为 New Charter 学院（现在的 Great Academy Ashton），以其赞助商 New Charter Housing Trust 的名字来命名。
The other secondary school in the town is St Damian's RC Science College, which was founded in 1963, and provides education for 800 pupils aged 11–16.	该镇的另一所中学是 St Damian's RC 科学学院，该学院成立于 1963 年，为 800 名 11–16 岁的学生提供教育。
As part of the Building Schools for the Future project, a replacement school building was built by Carillion and opened in May 2011.	作为“建设面向未来的学校”项目的一部分，Carillion 建造了一座替代性的教学楼，并于 2011 年 5 月开放。

Tameside College also provides opportunities for further education and operates in Ashton-under-Lyne, Droylsden, and Hyde.	Tameside 学院也提供继续教育机会，并在 Ashton-under-Lyne、Droylsden 和 Hyde 运营。
Founded in 1954 and expanded in 1957 and 1964, it was originally called Ashton College.	它成立于 1954 年，并在 1957 年和 1964 年进行了扩建，最初称为 Ashton 学院。
In the early 19th century, Ashton-under-Lyne's growth made it necessary to find a new water supply.	在 19 世纪初，Ashton-under-Lyne 的发展使得有必要寻找新水源。
Before the introduction of piped water the town's inhabitants drew water from wells and the nearby River Tame.	在引入自来水之前，该镇的居民从水井和附近的 Tame 河取水。
Industrial processes had, however, polluted the river and the wells could not sustain a rapidly expanding population.	然而，工业过程污染了河流，水井无法维持快速增长的人口。
From 1825, a private company was responsible for piping water from reservoirs, but there were still many homes without proper drainage or water supply.	从 1825 年起，一家私人公司负责输送水库中的水，但仍有许多家庭没有适当的排水或供水。

The first power station in Tameside was built in 1899, providing power for the area.	Tameside 的第一座发电站建于 1899 年，为该地区供电。
Ashton's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is United Utilities; there are no power stations in the town.	Ashton 配电网络运营商是 United  Utilities；该镇没有发电站。
United Utilities also manages the drinking and waste water.	United Utilities 还管理饮用水和废水。
In 1999, the Minneapolis Library Board issued a report entitled Outlook Twenty Ten identifying the changing needs of each of the system's libraries.	1999 年，明尼阿波利斯图书馆委员会发布了一份题为《展望 2010》的报告，确定了该系统各图书馆不断变化的需求。
Deeming Nokomis crowded and outdated, the report proposed three options.	该报告认为 Nokomis 很拥挤而且过时，因此提出了三种方案。
Option A proposed combining Nokomis with the nearby Roosevelt Community Library in a 25,000-square-foot (2,323 m²) space and closing both Nokomis and Roosevelt.	方案 A 建议将 Nokomis 与附近的 Roosevelt 社区图书馆合并为一个 25,000 平方英尺（2,323 平方米）的空间，并关闭 Nokomis 和 Roosevelt。
This would have allowed the library to operate out of a state-of-the-art building at an undecided location.	这样该图书馆将在一栋最先进的建筑中运作，地点未定。
Option B recommended moving Nokomis to a different site without moving Roosevelt.	方案 B 建议在不搬迁 Roosevelt 的情况下将 Nokomis 搬到另一个地方。
The new library there would have been 18,000 square feet (1,672 m²).	那里的新图书馆有 18,000 平方英尺（1,672 平方米）。
Option C included capital improvements to Nokomis, such as replacing carpeting, signs, and the roof.	方案 C 包括对 Nokomis 进行资本改进，如更换地毯、标志和屋顶。
A 2003 update to the report identified a project start date of 2007, with full closure in 2008 and a reopening in 2009.	2003 年更新的报告确定了项目开始日期为 2007 年，2008 年全面关闭，2009 年重新开放。
In 2007, the Minneapolis City Council appropriated a portion of its $1.35 billion 2008 budget for improvements to Nokomis and Northeast Community Library. $5.2 million of the $7 million project came from the city; Hennepin County put forward $1.8 million for environmental additions to the library and other features.	2007 年，明尼阿波利斯市议会从 2008 年 13.5 亿美元的预算中拨出一部分资金用于改善 Nokomis 和东北社区图书馆。在 700 万美元的项目中，有 520 万美元来自该市；Hennepin 县提出了 180 万美元用于图书馆的环境增设和其他功能。
The new building was designed by KKE Architects with significant input from a citizen advisory committee.	这栋新建筑由 KKE Architects 设计，并征求了市民咨询委员会的大量意见。
Ebert, Inc. was hired as the general contractor.	Ebert, Inc. 受雇成为总承包商。
The old building's last day of operation was September 12, 2009, at which time it was reported in the Longfellow/Nokomis Messenger that the renovated library was expected to reopen sometime in the fall of the next year.	旧楼的最后运营日期是 2009 年 9 月 12 日，当时 Longfellow/Nokomis Messenger 报道说，翻新后的图书馆预计于明年秋天的某个时候重新开放。
During the construction, patrons were encouraged to make use of nearby libraries including East Lake, Roosevelt, Washburn, and Southdale.	施工期间鼓励顾客使用附近的图书馆，包括 East Lake、Roosevelt、Washburn 和 Southdale。
The renovation included expanding the size of the library about 4,300 square feet (399 m²) to a total size of 17,340 square feet (1,611 m²).	翻修包括将图书馆面积扩大到大约 4,300 平方英尺（399 平方米），总面积为 17,340 平方英尺（1,611 平方米）。
A new lighting system that automatically adjusts based on the levels of light within the building was installed, along with a geothermal heating apparatus.	安装了一个新的照明系统，该系统可以根据建筑物内的光线水平自动调节，同时还安装了地热供暖设备。
Other environmentally friendly interior features included carpeting constructed from recycled fibers and low-flow faucets.	其他环保内饰包括由回收纤维制成的地毯和低流量的水龙头。

Orthogenesis, also known as orthogenetic evolution, progressive evolution, evolutionary progress, or progressionism, is the biological hypothesis that organisms have an innate tendency to evolve in a definite direction towards some goal (teleology) due to some internal mechanism or "driving force".	直生论，又称定向演化、渐进演化、进化性进步或进步主义，是一种生物学假说，即生物体由于某种内在机制或“驱动力”而具有向某个目标（目的论）的明确方向演化的先天倾向。
According to the theory, the largest-scale trends in evolution have an absolute goal such as increasing biological complexity.	根据该理论，演化中最大规模的趋势有绝对目标，如增加生物复杂性。
Prominent historical figures who have championed some form of evolutionary progress include Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and Henri Bergson.	拥护某种形式演化过程的知名历史人物包括 Jean-Baptiste Lamarck、Pierre Teilhard de Chardin 和 Henri Bergson。
The term orthogenesis was introduced by Wilhelm Haacke in 1893 and popularized by Theodor Eimer five years later.	直生论由 Wilhelm Haacke 于 1893 年提出，五年后由 Theodor Eimer 推广。
Proponents of orthogenesis had rejected the theory of natural selection as the organizing mechanism in evolution for a rectilinear model of directed evolution.	直生论的支持者拒绝将自然选择理论作为定向演化直线模式的演化组织机制。
With the emergence of the modern synthesis, in which genetics was integrated with evolution, orthogenesis and other alternatives to Darwinism were largely abandoned by biologists, but the notion that evolution represents progress is still widely shared.	随着现代综合论的出现，其中遗传学与演化相结合，直生论与其他替代达尔文主义的方法在很大程度上被生物学家放弃，但演化代表进步的概念依然得到广泛认同。
The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr made the term effectively taboo in the journal Nature in 1948, by stating that it implied "some supernatural force".	进化论生物学家 Ernst Mayr 于 1948 年在《自然》杂志上指出，这个词暗示“某种超自然的力量”，从而使得这个词成为禁忌。
The American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson (1953) attacked orthogenesis, linking it with vitalism by describing it as "the mysterious inner force".	美国古生物学家 George Gaylord Simpson (1953) 抨击了直生论，将其与活力论联系起来，称其为“神秘的内在力量”。
Modern supporters include E. O.	现代支持者包括 E. O.
Wilson and Simon Conway Morris, while museum displays and textbook illustrations continue to give the impression of progress in evolution.	Wilson 和 Simon Conway Morris，而博物馆展览和教科书插图继续给人以演化进步的印象。
The philosopher of biology Michael Ruse notes that in popular culture evolution and progress are synonyms, while the unintentionally misleading image of the March of Progress, from apes to modern humans, has been widely imitated.	生物学哲学家 Michael Ruse 指出，在流行文化中，演化和进步是同义词，而从猿猴到现代人类的进步进行曲这一无意中误导的形象被广泛模仿。
The term orthogenesis (from Ancient Greek ὀρθός orthós, "straight", and γένεσις génesis, "origin") was first used by the biologist Wilhelm Haacke in 1893.	生物学家 Wilhelm Haacke 在 1893 年首次使用了直生论（来自古希腊语 Greek ὀρθός orthós “直”和 γένεσις génesis “起源”）一词。
Theodor Eimer was the first to give the word a definition; he defined orthogenesis as "the general law according to which evolutionary development takes place in a noticeable direction, above all in specialized groups".	Theodor Eimer 是第一个给该词下定义的人；他将直生学定义为“某个明显的方向出现演化发展的一般规律，首先是在特定群体中发生”。
In 1922, the zoologist Michael F. Guyer wrote:	1922 年，动物学家 Michael F. Guyer 写道：
[Orthogenesis] has meant many different things to many different people, ranging from a mystical inner perfecting principle, to merely a general trend in development due to the natural constitutional restrictions of the germinal materials, or to the physical limitations imposed by a narrow environment.	[直生论]对许多不同的人来说有许多不同的含义，从神秘的内在完善原则，到仅仅由于生发材料的自然构成限制，或由于狭隘的环境所造成的物理限制而产生的一般发展趋势。
In most modern statements of the theory, the idea of continuous and progressive change in one or more characters, due according to some to internal factors, according to others to external causes-evolution in a "straight line" seems to be the central idea.	在该理论的大多数现代陈述中，一个或多个特征连续和渐进变化的观点，一些人说是由于内部因素，另一些人则说是外部原因 - “直线”演化似乎是中心思想。
According to Susan R. Schrepfer in 1983:	根据 Susan R. Schrepfer 在 1983 的说法：
Orthogenesis meant literally "straight origins", or "straight line evolution".	直生论的字面意思是“直接起源”或“直线演化”。
The term varied in meaning from the overtly vitalistic and theological to the mechanical.	从公然的活力论和神学到机械，这个词有不同的含义。
It ranged from theories of mystical forces to mere descriptions of a general trend in development due to natural limitations of either the germinal material or the environment ...	它的范围包括神秘力量理论到仅仅描述由于生发材料或环境的自然限制而导致的发展总趋势...
Few details are known about Smart's time at St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics.	关于 Smart 在 St Luke 精神病院的时间，其细节鲜为人知。
He was admitted to St Luke's on 6 May 1757 as a "Curable Patient".	他于 1757 年 5 月 6 日作为一名“可治愈的病人”进入 St Luke。
It is possible that Smart was confined at Newbery's behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart's immorality in A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High.	可能是由于旧债和两人之间存在的恶劣关系，Smart 在 Newbery 的授意下被关进了医院；Newbery 之前在《供六英尺高儿童娱乐的精美诗歌集》中嘲笑了 Smart 不道德的行为。
Regardless of Newbery's exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on madness.	不管 Newbery 的确切理由是什么，有证据表明 Newbery 将 Smart 送进精神病院并不是因为疯魔。
To have Smart admitted, Newbery probably provided a small bribe, although bribes were against St Luke's policy.	为了让 Smart 入院，Newbery 可能提供了一小笔贿赂，尽管贿赂有违 St Luke 政策。
There is little information about Smart's condition during his stay at St Luke's, possibly because Battie's denied his patients from being visited, including by their own family members.	关于 Smart 在 St Luke 期间的病情信息少之又少，可能是因为 Battie 拒绝外人探视他的病人，包括他们自己的家人。
One of the few records that survive of Smart's time at St Luke's was an entry in St Luke's Minute Book, which read:	关于 Smart 在 St Luke 的时间，现存的少数记录之一是 St Luke 记录簿中的一条记录，内容是：
12 May 1758	1758 年 5 月 12 日
Dr. Battie having acquainted this Committee that Christopher Smart (who was admitted on the 6th day of May 1757) continues disordered in his Senses notwithstanding he has been admitted into this Hospital above 12 Calendar Months and from the present Circumstances of his Case there is not Suffit.	Battie 医生通知本委员会，Christopher Smart（1757 年 5 月 6 日入院）尽管已经入院 12 个月以上，但他的感官仍然失常，从他目前的情况来看，没有足够的
reason to expect his speedy Recovery And he being brought up and examined.	理由期望他快速康复和接受照管与检查。
Ordered.	已下达命令。
That he be discharged and that Notice be sent to his Securities to take him away.	让他出院并向他的安保发出通知，让他们把他带走。
During Smart's confinement at St Luke's, not even other doctors were allowed to see Smart unless they had received personal permission from Battie.	在 Smart 被关在 St Luke 期间，甚至其他医生也不被允许见 Smart，除非他们得到 Battie 的亲自许可。
It was improbable that Smart could have left the asylum without being released by Battie.	在没有得到 Battie 释放的情况下，Smart 是不可能离开这家精神病院的。
Even if Smart would have attempted to obtain release via legal means, the rules for subpoenaing release would have been almost impossible to follow based on the system that Battie had in place, which isolated the individual from all contact.	即便 Smart 试图通过法律手段获释，根据 Battie 制定的隔绝个人一切联系的制度，传唤释放的规则也几乎不可能被遵守。
Eventually, Smart was deemed "incurable" and would not have been released by the hospital but for its lack of funds.	最终，Smart 被认为“无法治愈”，如果不是因为缺乏资金，医院不会将其释放。
There is little information about how and why Smart was released from asylum, but his daughter claimed: "He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness in placing him under necessary & salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure, invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more." What is known about the actual events is that John Sherratt, Christopher Smart's friend, believed that Smart's confinement was unfair and wanted to negotiate Smart's release.	关于 Smart 如何以及为何从精神病院放出来的信息少之又少，但他的女儿声称：”他逐渐好转，一些判断错误的朋友误解了 Newbery 对他进行必要且有益的限制的好意，邀请他共进晚餐，他也不再回到禁闭室。”对于实际事件，已知的信息是 Christopher Smart 的朋友 John Sherratt 认为对 Smart 的监禁不公，并希望就释放 Smart 进行协商。
In January 1763, he met with a parliamentary committee to discuss the issue of individuals falsely imprisoned and abuses that they would receive in asylums.	1763 年 1 月，他会见了议会委员会, 讨论个人被错误监禁以及他们在精神病院会遭受虐待的问题。
In particular, Sherratt argued that many were admitted for habitual intoxication, which undermined Battie's and other asylum keeper's reputations.	特别是，Sherratt 认为许多人是因习惯性醉酒而被入院，这破坏了 Battie 和精神病院其他守卫的声誉。
A finding by the parliamentary committee released 27 January 1763 bolstered Sherratt's chances to release Smart.	1763 年 1 月 27 日公布的议会委员会的调查结果支持了 Sherratt 释放 Smart 的可能性。
Carl Michael Bellman is the central figure in Swedish song, known for his 1790 Fredman's Epistles and his 1791 Fredman's Songs.	Carl Michael Bellman 是瑞典歌界的核心人物，以 1790 年的《弗里曼书信》和 1791 年的《弗里曼之歌》而闻名。
He played the cittern, accompanying himself as he performed his songs at the royal court.	他在皇家宫廷演奏他的歌曲时，会弹奏西特琴，为自己伴奏。
Jean Fredman is a fictional character and the supposed narrator in Bellman's epistles and songs, based on a real watchmaker of Bellman's Stockholm.	Jean Fredman 是一个虚构人物，也是 Bellman 的书信和歌曲中的所谓叙述者，其原型就是 Bellman 在斯德哥尔摩的一个真实的钟表匠。
The epistles paint a picture of the demimonde life of the city during the eighteenth century, where strong drink and beautiful "nymphs" like Ulla Winblad create a rococo picture of life, blending classical allusion and pastoral description with harsh reality.	书信描绘了十八世纪城市的暗娼阶层生活，那里的烈酒和像 Ulla Winblad 这样美丽的“仙女”营造了一幅洛可可式的生活画面，将古典典故和田园描述与残酷的现实融为一体。
Epistle 82 has been recorded by Fred Åkerström, where it forms the title track of his third album of Bellman interpretations, as well as by Sven-Bertil Taube.	82 号书信由 Fred Åkerström 和 Sven-Bertil Taube 录制，成为他第三章 Bellman 演绎专辑的主打曲目。
It has been translated into English by Eva Toller.	它已被 Eva Toller 翻译成英文。
The song has featured in at least 16 Swedish films from 1929 onwards.	从 1929 年起，这首歌至少在 16 部瑞典电影中出现过。
Lars Lönnroth, writing in Svenska Dagbladet, suggests that the "spring" in the Epistle was in fact not a stream in summer meadows but a fashionable spa, perhaps Djurgårsbrunn on what was in Bellman's time the edge of Stockholm.	Lars Lönnroth 在 Svenska Dagbladet 中写道，书信中的“春天”其实不是夏天草地上的溪流，而是时尚的 spa，也许是 Bellman 时代斯德哥尔摩边缘的 Djurgårsbrunn。
Henrik Mickos, in the 2011 Bellman lecture, discussed what the "pimpinella" of the first verse might be, concluding that salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) was quite likely, given it was known at the time as pimpinella, and was more common in Sweden then than it is now.	Henrik Mickos 在 2011 年的 Bellman 讲座中讨论了第一节的“pimpinella”可能是什么，结论是很可能是小地榆 (Sanguisorba minor) ，因为当时它被称为 pimpinella，而且那时在瑞典比现在更常见。
Mickos dismisses the possibility that it was aniseed (Pimpinella anisum), which was used to flavour brännvin but not as the song has it ("red wine and pimpinella") a wine-based punch.	Mickos 否定了这是八角茴香 (Pimpinella anisum) 的可能性，茴香是用来给 brännvin 调味的，但不是像歌曲中所说的那样（“红酒和茴香”）是一种葡萄酒潘趣。
Writing for The Boston Globe, Michael Andor Brodeur argued that while the show may feel like an advertisement for emoji, "the most satisfying part is watching self-proclaimed enthusiasts of the form stumble through their symbols once the difficulty is ever-so-slightly notched up....watching so much get lost in translation feels like a win.	Michael Andor Brodeur 为《波士顿环球报》撰文指出，虽然该节目可能感觉像是表情符号的广告，但“最令人满意的部分是看着自称为该形式的爱好者，一旦难度稍微提高，就只能勉强完成他们的符号...看到转换过程中失去了这么多信息，感觉是一种胜利。
In terms of ratings, the series' first two episodes debuted to 336,000 and 322,000 respective viewers, with a 0.10 and 0.09 18–49 rating respectively.	在收视率方面，该系列前两集的观众分别为 336,000 和 322,000 人，18–49 岁人群中的收视率分别为 0.10 和 0.09。
The episode followed up on the plot introduced in the final instalment of the second season in which a probe from an unknown alien race attacks Earth.	这一集延续了第二季最后一集介绍的情节，其中一个来自未知外星种族的探测器袭击了地球。
A number of new sets and costumes were required, with preparations beginning for some departments up to three weeks before filming began.	需要一些新的布景和服装，一些部门在开拍前三周就开始进行准备。
One change which was made was a new outfit for T'Pol, with costume tests taking place a week before filming began.	其中一个变化是为 T'Pol 换了新装，在开拍前一周进行了服装测试。
The redesign was because of studio executives wanting the show to appeal more to the 18–49 male demographic.	重新设计的原因是制片厂高层希望该剧能够更多地吸引 18-49 岁的男性人群。
The production team looked to the mid-series boost that the introduction of Seven of Nine provided on Star Trek: Voyager and sought for Enterprise to appeal to that demographic in the same manner.	制作团队参考了《星际迷航：航海家号》中引入九之七所带来的中期系列推进，并寻求企业号以同样的方式吸引该人群。
Kate O'Hara of New York Magazine later joked in reference to the change, "Women of the future will certainly choose to wear tight, uncomfortable, skin-tight catsuits!"	纽约杂志的 Kate O'Hara 后来在谈到这一变化时开玩笑说：“未来的女性肯定会选择穿紧身、不舒服的连体衣。”
"The Xindi" was seen as a new pilot by executive producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode.	“新地”被执行制片人 Brannon Braga 和 Rick Berman 看做是新试播集，他们也是这一集的编剧。
Braga said "We were re-establishing an Enterprise that was going to be a little bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms." They felt the best way to do this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to do in order to introduce them as well.	Braga 说：“我们正在重建企业号，今年会有点不同，所以我们必须从这些方面考虑。”他们认为做到这一点的最好方法就是立即向观众展示新地，给 MACO 安排一些事情做以便引入他们。
He called it a "big episode" as they sought to set up the rest of season.	他称这是一个“大集”，因为他们要为该季的其余部分做准备。
The shoot began on June 26, 2003, with the expectation that it would take nine days (as opposed to the usual seven) to complete.	拍摄于 2003 年 6 月 26 日开始，预计需要 9 天（而不是通常的 7 天）才能完成。
One of the special effects on the episode used ground Styrofoam which had been painted blue and processed through a wood chipper.	这一集的特效之一是使用了被涂成蓝色并通过碎木机处理过的聚苯乙烯泡沫塑料。
It was used to represent the mineral Trellium-D within the mine.	它被用来代表矿井中的矿物 Trellium-D。
However, the ground Styrofoam stuck to the actors' shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed.	然而，地面上的泡沫塑料粘在了演员的鞋服上，最后散落在拍摄该剧的派拉蒙摄制场。
It would turn up in unexpected places on set for the rest of the series, and was found in among the sets as they were being dismantled after the end of season four.	它会在该系列的其余部分出现在片场意想不到的地方，并在第四季结束后被拆除时在片场发现。
"The Xindi" featured several actors who would go on to recur in their roles throughout the third season of Enterprise.	“新地”中有几位演员，他们将在《企业号》第三季继续扮演其角色。
These included the MACO marines under the command of Major Hayes, played by Steven Culp.	其中包括由 Steven Culp 饰演的海斯少校指挥的 MACO 海军陆战队。
At the time of his appearance in "The Xindi", he felt that he did not have any characterisation to work with.	在出演“新地”时，他觉得自己没有任何角色刻画可言。
During the production of his second episode, "The Shipment", Culp read an article in the Los Angeles Times about a troubled youth who joined the military and in serving in the Iraq War had found himself.	在制作第二集“战舰”时，Culp 读到了《洛杉矶时报》上的一篇文章，其中讲述了一名问题青年参军并在伊拉克战争中服役时找到自我。
After discussing it with the director, this became the basis for the character.	在与导演讨论后，这成为了这个角色的基础。
Daniel Dae Kim made his first of three appearances in "The Xindi" as Corporal Chang; he had previously appeared as Gotana-Retz in the Voyager episode "Blink of an Eye".	Daniel Dae Kim 在“新地”中首次出场，饰演张下士；他曾在《航海家号》的“眨眼”这一集中饰演 Gotana-Retz。
The band were afforded more time to record than previous endeavors, and were listening to music such as Jawbreaker, Bad Religion and Lagwagon, which influenced the album.	与以前的努力相比，乐队获得了更多的时间来录音，并聆听了对专辑产生影响的 Jawbreaker、Bad Religion 和 Lagwagon 等音乐。
For production duties, the band worked with Mark Trombino, who provided additional piano and keyboards on Dude Ranch.	在制作方面，乐队与 Mark Trombino 合作，他在“观光牧场”中提供了额外的钢琴和键盘。
The trio picked him based on his work he had done on Jimmy Eat World's Static Prevails (1996). The group spent time trying to amuse Trombino, to no avail.	这个三人组是根据他为 Jimmy Eat World 的“静占上风”(1996) 所做的工作而挑选了他。该小组花了一些时间试图逗乐 Trombino，但无济于事。
Hoppus' sister, Anne Hoppus, described Trombino as very quiet during the sessions.	Hoppus 的妹妹 Anne Hoppus 描述说，Trombino 在会议期间非常安静。
Trombino, in a retrospective piece about the album, mentioned that he was "excited, but also nervous and intimidated.	Trombino 在关于这张专辑的回顾文章中提到，他“很兴奋，但也很紧张和害怕。
I felt weird that there were these guys who had sold way more records than I had ever sold and I'm sitting in the producer’s chair telling them what to do." Dude Ranch was recorded Big Fish Studios in Rancho Santa Fe, California in December 1996.	我觉得很奇怪，这些人的唱片销量远超于我，而我却坐在制片人的椅子上告诉他们该怎么做。”“观光牧场”于 1996 年 12 月在加州 Rancho Santa Fe 的大鱼录音棚录制。
Big Fish was a converted guesthouse which had just survived a wildfire months before.	大鱼是一间经过改造的宾馆，几个月前刚从一场野火中幸存下来。
However, the gloomy atmosphere did not faze Blink-182 at all, and what was a tragedy to local individuals became fodder for jokes for the group.	然而，阴暗的气氛丝毫没有让 Blink-182 感到害怕，对当地人来说是一场悲剧，但对这个团体来说却成了笑料的素材。
Bassist Mark Hoppus had just bought a new video camera and he filmed stunts with guitarist Tom DeLonge on the burnt landscape in spare time.	贝斯手 Mark Hoppus 刚刚买了一台新摄像机，他在业余时间与吉他手Tom DeLonge 在被烧毁的景观上拍摄了特技表演。
Despite this, Trombino was impressed by their work ethic: "They were the most business-centric band I'd ever seen at that point.	尽管如此，Trombino 对他们的工作态度印象深刻：“他们是我在那时见过的最以商业为中心的乐队。
They had their shit together."	他们很振作。”
Despite the creative boom while writing lyrics for the album, all three members of Blink-182 faced setbacks while recording Dude Ranch.	尽管在为专辑创作歌词时创意澎湃，但 Blink-182 的三位成员在录制“观光牧场”时都面临挫折。
DeLonge was having vocal problems and spent much time recording and re-recording vocal tracks, and Hoppus realized he too was having difficulty singing after losing his voice during a one-off Christmas concert.	DeLonge 的嗓子出了问题，花了很多时间录制和重录人声曲目，Hoppus 在一场一次性的圣诞音乐会上失声后，发现他也出现了歌唱困难。
Hoppus realized the magnitude of the situation and cancelled the final week of recording in December 1996.	Hoppus 意识到情况的严重，取消了 1996 年 12 月最后一周的录音。
He quit smoking in order to take care of his voice, which was stressed due to lack of vocal warm-ups, full days of vocal tracks, and the strain of singing for "Dammit", which was accidentally written just outside his vocal range.	为照顾他的嗓子，他戒了烟，由于缺乏声乐热身、成天的声乐曲目以及歌唱“Dammit”的压力，这首歌意外地写在他的音域之外。
Meanwhile, Raynor had to record his drum tracks while still in his wheelchair, the result of injuries sustained at the signing party.	同时，由于 Raynor 在签名会上受伤，他不得不在轮椅上录制鼓音轨。
He would wheelchair up to the drum set and scoot onto the drum throne and play," remembered Trombino in a later interview.	在后来的采访中，Trombino 回忆道：“他坐着轮椅来到架子鼓前，溜到鼓座上演奏。
"I got the sense that [the band] were bummed." Aside from the recording, the band spent time playing Crash Bandicoot and "reading the articles from the shelves and shelves of Playboys that the studio had thoughtfully provided." The group ate lunch nearly each day at Sombrero, a local Mexican restaurant namedropped in "Josie", and Chinese for dinner from Encinitas' Pick Up Stix.	“我感觉到[乐队]很沮丧。”除了录音之外，乐队还花时间演奏 Crash Bandicoot，并“阅读录音棚贴心提供的《花花公子》书架上的文章。” 这群人几乎每天都在“乔西”中提到的当地墨西哥餐厅 Sombrero 用午餐，晚餐则是在 Encinitas 的 Pick Up Stix 用中餐。
It would be January 1997 until the band would be able to wrap up sessions for Dude Ranch, eventually amounting to five weeks of recording.	直到 1997 年 1 月，乐队才得以结束“观光牧场”的录音，最终录制了五周时间。
For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using a sound-effects machine he owned.	在最后的润色中，Unwritten Law 的主唱 Scott Russo 为“乔西”献出了几首人声曲目，Trombino 让 Blink-182 用他的一台音效机在歌曲之间录制了几个笑话。
Plunketts Creek is in the West Branch Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Susquehannocks.	普朗克提溪位于萨斯奎哈纳河流域的西支流，那里有记录的最早居民是萨斯奎汉诺克人。
Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes.	由于疾病和与易洛魁五部落联盟的战争，他们的人数极大减少，到 1675 年，他们已经灭绝、迁往别处或被其他部落同化。
The West Branch Susquehanna River valley was subsequently under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who invited displaced tribes, including the Lenape (Delaware) and Shawnee to live in the lands vacated by the Susquehannocks.	萨斯奎哈纳河谷西支流后来名义上由易洛魁人控制，他们邀请包括德拉瓦族（特拉华）和肖尼族在内无家可归的部落在萨斯奎哈诺克人腾出的土地上生活。
The French and Indian War (1754–1763) led to the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin.	法国印第安人战争 (1754–1763) 导致许多美洲原住民向西迁徙至俄亥俄河流域。
On November 5, 1768, the British acquired the New Purchase from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, including what is now Plunketts Creek.	1768 年 11 月 5 日，英国人签订斯坦维克斯堡条约，从易洛魁人手中买下这片土地，包括现在的普朗克提溪。
The first settlement along the creek by European colonists took place between 1770 and 1776.	1770 年至 1776 年，欧洲殖民者沿着这条小溪建立了第一个定居点。
Plunketts Creek is named for Colonel William Plunkett, a physician, who was the first president judge of Northumberland County after it was formed in 1772.	普朗克提溪是以科洛内尔•威廉•普朗克提医生命名的，他是 1772 年诺森伯兰县成立后的首任主审法官。
During conflicts with Native Americans, he treated wounded settlers and fought the natives.	在与美洲原住民的冲突中，他救治了受伤的殖民者并与原住民战斗。
Plunkett led a Pennsylvania expedition in the Pennamite-Yankee War to forcibly remove settlers from Connecticut, who had claimed and settled on lands in the Wyoming Valley also claimed by Pennsylvania.	普朗克提在宾那迈与扬基之战中领导一支宾夕法尼亚探险队，将殖民者从康涅狄格州强行驱离，这些殖民者曾声称拥有怀俄明山谷的土地并定居在那里，而宾夕法尼亚州同样声称拥有那片土地。
For his services, Plunkett was granted six tracts of land that totaled 1,978 acres (800 ha) on November 14, 1776, although the land was not actually surveyed until September 1783.	为了表彰他的贡献，1776 年 11 月 14 日，普朗克提获得六块总共 1,978 英亩（800 公顷）的土地，但直到 1783 年 9 月才对这片土地进行实际测量。
Plunkett's land included the creek's mouth, so Plunketts Creek was given his name.	普朗克提的土地中包含这条小溪的河口，因此普朗克提溪以他的名字命名。
He died in 1791, aged about 100, and was buried in Northumberland without a grave marker or monument (except for the creek that bears his name).	他于 1791 年去世，享年 100 岁左右，安葬于诺森伯兰县，没有墓碑或纪念碑（除了以他的名字命名的小溪）。
Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County in 1795.	莱康明县于 1795 年由诺森伯兰县成立。
When Plunketts Creek Township was formed in Lycoming County in 1838, the original name proposed was "Plunkett Township", but Plunkett's lack of active support for the American Revolution some years earlier had led some to believe his loyalty lay with the British Empire.	1838 年，普朗克提溪镇在莱康明县成立时，最初提议的名称是“普朗克提镇”，但几年前普朗克提没有对美国独立战争提供积极的支持，导致有些人认为他效忠于大英帝国。
The lingering suspicion of his loyalist sympathies led to the proposed name being rejected.	由于仍然怀疑他是否支持他所效忠的人，因此该提议名称被拒绝。
Naming the township for the creek rather than its namesake was seen as an acceptable compromise.	用这条小溪而不是同名之人的名字命名该镇被认为是一种可以接受的折中方案。
In 1832, John Barbour built a sawmill on Loyalsock Creek near the mouth of Plunketts Creek.	1832 年，约翰•巴伯在普朗克提溪河口附近的洛亚尔索克溪上建了一座锯木厂。
This developed into the village of Barbours Mills, today known as Barbours.	这就发展形成了巴伯米尔斯村，如今称为巴伯斯。
In the 19th century, Barbours had several blacksmiths, a temperance hotel, post office, many sawmills, a school, store and wagon maker.	在 19 世纪，巴伯斯有几个铁匠、一家禁酒旅馆、邮局、许多锯木厂、一所学校、商店和马车制造商。
In 1840, a road was built north from Barbours along Plunketts Creek, crossing it several times.	1840 年，从巴伯斯向北沿着普朗克提溪修建了一条马路，这条马路多次穿过小溪。
Rubidium was discovered in 1861 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, in Heidelberg, Germany, in the mineral lepidolite through flame spectroscopy.	1861 年，罗伯特•本生和古斯塔夫•基尔霍夫于德国海德堡通过火焰光谱法在矿物锂云母中发现铷。
Because of the bright red lines in its emission spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word rubidus, meaning "deep red".	由于其发射光谱中有明亮的红色线条，他们选择了一个源自拉丁语 rubidus 的名字，意为“深红色”。
Rubidium is a minor component in lepidolite.	铷是锂云母中的微量成分。
Kirchhoff and Bunsen processed 150 kg of a lepidolite containing only 0.24% rubidium oxide (Rb₂O).	基尔霍夫和本生处理了 150 kg 的锂云母，其中仅含 0.24% 的一氧化铷 (Rb₂O)。
Both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid, but those salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water.	钾和铷均与氯铂酸形成不溶性盐，但这些盐在热水中的溶解度略有不同。
Therefore, the less soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate (Rb₂PtCl₆) could be obtained by fractional crystallization.	因此，溶解度更低的六氯铂酸铷 (Rb₂PtCl₆) 可以通过分离结晶方法获得。
After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen, the process yielded 0.51 grams of rubidium chloride for further studies.	用氢还原六氯铂酸铷后，该过程产生 0.51 克氯化铷供进一步研究。
Bunsen and Kirchhoff began their first large-scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds with 44,000 litres (12,000 US gal) of mineral water, which yielded 7.3 grams of caesium chloride and 9.2 grams of rubidium chloride.	本生和基尔霍夫开始用 44,000 升（12,000 美制加仑）矿泉水，首次大规模分离铯和铷成分，产生 7.3 克氯化铯和 9.2 克氯化铷。
Rubidium was the second element, shortly after caesium, to be discovered by spectroscopy, just one year after the invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.	铷是继发现铯后不久，通过光谱学发现的第二个元素，而这仅发生在本生和基尔霍夫发明光谱仪一年后。
The two scientists used the rubidium chloride to estimate that the atomic weight of the new element was 85.36 (the currently accepted value is 85.47).	两位科学家利用氯化铷估算出新元素的原子量为 85.36（目前的公认值为 85.47）。
They tried to generate elemental rubidium by electrolysis of molten rubidium chloride, but instead of a metal, they obtained a blue homogeneous substance, which "neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope showed the slightest trace of metallic substance".	他们试图通过电解熔化的氯化铷生成铷元素，但他们得到的不是金属，而是蓝色的均质物质，这种物质“无论用肉眼还是显微镜观察，都丝毫没有表现出金属物质的痕迹”。
They presumed that it was a subchloride (Rb	他们推测它是一种低氯化物 (Rb
₂Cl); however, the product was probably a colloidal mixture of the metal and rubidium chloride.	₂Cl)；但是，这个产物很可能是金属与氯化铷的胶体混合物。
In a second attempt to produce metallic rubidium, Bunsen was able to reduce rubidium by heating charred rubidium tartrate.	在第二次尝试生成金属铷时，本生能够通过加热焦化的酒石酸降低铷的含量。
Although the distilled rubidium was pyrophoric, they were able to determine the density and the melting point.	虽然蒸馏出的铷会自燃，但他们能够确定密度和熔点。
The quality of this research in the 1860s can be appraised by the fact that their determined density differs by less than 0.1 g/cm³ and the melting point by less than 1 °C from the presently accepted values.	19 世纪 60 年代的这项研究的质量值得肯定：因为他们确定的密度与目前的公认值相差小于 0.1 g/cm³，而熔点则相差小于 1 °C。
The slight radioactivity of rubidium was discovered in 1908, but that was before the theory of isotopes was established in 1910, and the low level of activity (half-life greater than 10¹⁰ years) made interpretation complicated.	铷的轻微放射性是在 1908 年发现的，但这是在 1910 年同位素理论建立之前，而且其低水平的活性（半衰期大于 10¹⁰ 年）导致解释起来相当复杂。
The now proven decay of ⁸⁷Rb to stable ⁸⁷Sr through beta decay was still under discussion in the late 1940s.	现在已经证实的 ⁸⁷Rb 通过贝塔衰变，衰变到稳定的 ⁸⁷Sr 的过程在 20 世纪 40 年代后期仍在讨论中。
Rubidium had minimal industrial value before the 1920s.	在 20 世纪 20 年代以前，铷的工业价值很小。
Since then, the most important use of rubidium is research and development, primarily in chemical and electronic applications.	从那以后，铷的最重要用途是研究和开发，主要用于化学和电子应用。
The history of the tea processing corresponds intimately with the role that tea played in Chinese society and the preferred methods of its consumption in ancient Chinese society.	茶叶的加工史与茶叶在中国社会扮演的角色以及中国古代社会偏好的茶叶消费方式密切相关。
Variations of these processing techniques are still used in modern tea processing albeit being far more mechanized.	这些加工技术的变型在现代茶叶加工中仍旧使用，只是机械化程度更高。
The ancient Chinese society first encountered the tea plant in what is now southern China and processed it as another medicinal herb for use in Chinese herbology.	中国古代社会最先在现在的中国南方发现茶树，并将其加工成另一种草药，用于中草药学。
The processing technique used to process fresh tea leaves was to immediately steam the fresh tea leaves and dry them for preservation, which is likely the most ancient Chinese form of tea leaf processing.	用于加工鲜茶叶的加工技术是，立即将鲜茶叶蒸青并烘干以便保存，这可能是中国最古老的茶叶加工方式。
This processing method was perfected near the end of the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) and produced a dried tea that would be classified today as "green tea" and quite similar to modern Japanese sencha.	这种加工方法在汉朝末期（公元前 206 年至公元 220 年）得到完善，制成了今天归类为“绿茶”的干茶，它与现代的日本煎茶很相似。
For consumption, dried tea leaves were either decocted with water around with other herbs, or ground into a powder to be taken straight, or in a liquid in the manner of matcha.	食用时，干茶叶或用水与其他草药一同煎煮，或磨成粉末直接服用，或以抹茶的方式加入液体中。
With the increase of tea's use in Chinese herbology, production methods changed, where the processed green tea leaves were not immediately dried after steaming.	随着茶叶在中草药学中使用量的增加，制作方法发生改变，加工后的绿茶叶在蒸青后不会立即烘干。
Rather the steamed tea leaves were first pulverized into a paste form, with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea, a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea.	蒸青后的茶叶先磨成糊状，然后将糊状物在模具中定型并缓慢烘干成茶砖，这项技术在陆羽所著的《茶经》中进行了详细介绍。
Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used, as older mature tea leaves were preferred for tea production.	嫩叶和叶芽一般不会使用，因为较老的成熟茶叶更适合制茶。
Some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves, which typically required the use of a cooked rice slurry (米湯) to bind the tea brick together.	一些茶砖也由成熟的整片叶子制成，这通常需要使用煮熟的米汤将茶砖粘合在一起。
The preference of producing tea in brick form possibly stems from the fact that it can be more easily transported and stored.	人们喜欢将茶叶制成茶砖可能是因为它更容易运输和储存。
The use of steam in fixation (殺青) of tea leaf enzymes is an important step in processing tea, with the leaves quickly cooled down and then undergoing further processing.	利用蒸汽对茶叶酶进行杀青是加工茶叶的重要步骤，在这个步骤中，茶叶迅速冷却，然后进行进一步加工。
The less tightly controlled methods of it in the past resulted in the creation of "yellow tea" when the tea leaves were over-steamed for fixation or were not quickly spread out, doused with water and cooled.	过去这种控制不太严格的方法导致在茶叶过度蒸煮以杀青或未迅速散开、浇水和冷却时会形成“黄茶”。
Although green tea was the most popular in Lu Yu's time, he personally considered yellow tea to be superior to green.	虽然在陆羽时代，最受欢迎的是绿茶，但他个人认为黄茶要优于绿茶。
Even when the leaves were quickly cooled, if they are left in piles (渥堆) for too long before processing, the leaves will begin to undergo microbial fermentation to produce "post-fermented tea".	即使在茶叶迅速冷却后，如果在加工前渥堆时间过久，茶叶也会开始进行微生物发酵，产生“后发酵茶”。
This technique is somewhat similar to composting, albeit tightly controlled, and still used in the production of Liu'an tea (安徽六安籃茶) and was more recently introduced for the production of the "ripe" type pu-erh tea.	这种技术有点类似于堆肥，虽然受到严格控制，但仍被用于生产安徽六安篮茶，最近则被用于生产属于“熟茶”类型的普洱茶。
The production of tea in brick forms and their storage also resulted in another type of post-fermented tea, which was produced by aging.	茶砖在生产及储存过程中还能够演变成另一种类型的后发酵茶，它是通过陈化生产的。
The long transport and storage times of the day unwittingly allowed the tea bricks to undergo prolonged exposure to the elements and to various microflora, which resulted in the aging, oxidation, and fermentation of green brick teas.	一天中漫长的运输和储存会不知不觉地使茶砖长时间暴露在各种元素和各种微生物区系中，从而导致绿茶茶砖发生陈化、氧化和发酵。
A brick of green tea that had been stored and aged into post-fermented tea was charred over charcoal to rid it of the layer of detritus, dust, and shiny multicoloured growths before being broken down into a powder, cooked, and then consumed.	将经储存并陈化制成的后发酵茶的绿茶茶砖放在木炭上烧焦，以去除碎屑、灰尘和闪亮多彩的杂质，然后即可将其拆成粉末、烹煮并饮用。
By the end of Tang Dynasty (618-907CE) green, yellow, and post-fermented tea was commonly used in China and moved from purely being used in herbology to becoming a beverage drunk for pleasure.	唐朝末年（公元 618-907 年），绿茶、黄茶和后发酵茶在中国受到普遍使用，并从纯粹用作草药转变为休闲饮品。
New Directions' director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) suspects that cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) has been colluding with rival glee clubs, and visits the Jane Addams Academy for girls recently released from juvenile detention.	新方向主管威尔·舒斯特（马修·莫里森饰）怀疑啦啦队教练苏·西尔维斯特（简·林奇饰）与竞争对手的欢乐合唱团勾结，并到简·亚当斯学院探访了最近从少年拘留所获释的女孩们。
When their club director Grace Hitchens (Eve) reveals the extent of the school's under-funding, Will invites her club to perform in the McKinley High auditorium.	当他们的合唱团主管格蕾丝·希钦斯（伊芙饰）透露学校资金不足的程度时，威尔邀请她的合唱团在麦金利高中礼堂演出。
Will is intimidated by their opposition, but Rachel (Lea Michele) assures him that the girls are using the power of "hairography"—frequent, dramatic hair-tossing—to distract from the fact their singing and dancing ability is limited. Will purchases wigs for New Directions and has them utilize hairography themselves, performing a mash-up of "Hair" and "Crazy in Love".	威尔被她们的反对声吓到了，但瑞秋（莉亚·米歇尔饰）向他保证，女孩们将动用“发型”的力量（频繁、夸张地甩头发）来转移人们对她们唱歌和跳舞能力有限这一事实的注意力。威尔为新方向购买了假发，并让他们自己能够利用起发型，完成了《Hair》与《Crazy in Love》的混音表演。
Dalton Rumba (Michael Hitchcock), glee club director at Haverbrook School for the Deaf, feels slighted by the invitation Will extended to the Jane Addams Academy, and arranges for his own club to also perform at McKinley High.	哈维布鲁克聋哑学校的欢乐合唱团主管道尔顿·伦巴（迈克尔·希区柯克饰）因威尔向简·亚当斯学院发出邀请而感觉受到轻视，并安排他自己的合唱团也前往麦金利高中进行演出。
His club duets with New Directions on John Lennon's "Imagine", and Will realizes that the new mash-up and hairography routine is not working.	他的合唱团与新方向合唱了约翰·列侬的《Imagine》，威尔意识到新的混音和发型这种惯用做法将不起作用。
He removes it from the club's set-list, replacing it with a performance of "True Colors".	他将它从合唱团的演出曲目中删除，取而代之的是表演了一首《True Colors》。
Unbeknownst to Will, Sue reveals two songs from New Directions' line-up for sectionals to Grace and Dalton, suggesting they have their own clubs perform them to gain an edge in the competition.	威尔不知道的是，苏向格蕾丝和道尔顿透露了新方向节目阵容中的两首歌曲，建议他们让自己的合唱团表演这些歌曲以在比赛中获得优势。

She tells Terri she wants to keep the baby, but in an effort to change her mind, Terri's sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen) has Quinn babysit her three unruly sons.	她告诉泰瑞她想留下孩子，但为了改变她的主意，泰瑞的姐姐肯德拉（詹妮弗·阿斯彭饰）让奎因照看她三个任性的儿子。
Quinn invites Puck to babysit with her and the two bond, however when Quinn discovers that Puck spent the evening sexting his ex-girlfriend Santana (Naya Rivera), she re-commits to having the baby adopted, believing her daughter deserves a better father.	奎因邀请帕克与她一起照看这两个累赘，然而当奎因发现帕克整晚都在给他的前女友桑塔纳（娜雅·里维拉饰）发色情短信时，她认为她的女儿应该有一位更好的父亲，因此重新承诺让孩子被人收养。
Kurt (Chris Colfer) gives Rachel a make-over, ostensibly to help her attract Finn, but in reality attempting to sabotage her chances with him.	科特（克里斯·柯尔弗饰）给瑞秋化了妆，表面上是为了帮她吸引芬恩，但实际上是在试图破坏她和他在一起的机会。
Finn is unimpressed with Rachel's new look before telling her he remembered having the conversation with Kurt about what he liked in girls.	芬恩对瑞秋的新面貌无动于衷，然后告诉她他记得曾与科特谈论过他喜欢女孩的哪些特质。
Rachel confronts Kurt, stating that even if he is in love with Finn, she will always have a better chance "because [she's] a girl".	瑞秋对峙科特，说即使他爱上了芬恩，她的机会也总是更大，“因为[她]是个女孩”。
But Kurt tells her that they are both kidding themselves: Finn is in love with Quinn and nothing will change that.	但科特告诉她，他们俩都是在自欺欺人：芬恩爱上了奎因，什么也改变不了这一点。
"Hairography" was written by series creator Ian Brennan, and directed by Bill D'Elia.	《Hairography》由剧集创作者伊安·布瑞南编写，由比尔·德埃利亚执导。

SH-58 was first commissioned some time between March 1, 1930 and December 1, 1931.	SH-58 于 1930 年 3 月 1 日至 1931 年 12 月 1 日之间的某一时间首次投入使用。
The original extent of the route was much shorter than the present highway.	这条公路的原始长度比现今的高速公路要短得多。
In 1931, SH-58 was a dirt road extending from SH-8 east of Fairview north to Ringwood.	SH-58 在 1931 年还是一条土路，从费尔维尤北部的 SH-8 东段延伸至灵伍德。
Prior to receiving the SH-58 designation, this section of road was part of US-164 and the first SH-13.	在被冠以 SH-58 这一名称之前，该路段是 US-164 的部分路段和 SH-13 的起始路段。
On May 29, 1930, AASHO approved an extension of US-60 that replaced US-164.	1930 年 5 月 29 日，AASHO 批准了延长 US-60，以取代 US-164。
When US-60 replaced US-164 through the area, it was changed to the more westerly route it takes in the present day.	当 US-60 取代 US-164 贯通该地区时，它变成了如今更加偏西的公路。
The section of old U.S. highway that no longer had a designation became SH-58.	旧的美国高速公路中不再具备冠名的路段变成了 SH-58。
Throughout the 1930s, SH-58 was expanded in both directions.	20 世纪 30 年代，SH-58 向两个方向进行了扩建。
The first addition to the highway came during the first half of 1932, when the highway was extended north to Helena.	高速公路于 1932 年上半年进行了首次增建，向北延伸至海伦娜。
No east–west highway existed at this point yet, leading to a spur end.	此时还没有东西向高速公路，通往支线尽头。
The highway was extended to the south, replacing SH-44, to Canton on March 29, 1937. SH-58 was extended north to the Kansas state line sometime between April 1937 and April 1938.	高速公路于 1937 年 3 月 29 日向南延伸至坎顿，取代了 SH-44。SH-58 于 1937 年 4 月至 1938 年 4 月之间的某一时间向北延伸至堪萨斯州州道。
This final extension brought SH-58's northern section to its present-day termini, and no major changes to the northern section have occurred since.	最后这次扩建将 SH-58 的北路段带到了如今的终点，北路段此后便没有发生过重大变化。
SH-58's southern section was first established on October 16, 1945, when SH-54 was given a new alignment further to the west; its old alignment was redesignated as SH-58.	SH-58 的南段首建于 1945 年 10 月 16 日，当时 SH-54 被分配了更靠西的新路线；它的旧路线被重新冠名为 SH-58。
The original routing of SH-58's southern section began at US-277 in Cyril, continued west through Apache, and turned north at the present-day western intersection of with SH-19.	SH-58 南段的最初路线始于西里尔的 US-277，继续向西穿过阿帕奇，并在如今与 SH-19 西段的交汇处向北转。
SH-58 continued north along its present alignment to Hydro, where it ended at US-66/SH-1.	SH-58 如今的路线继续向北延伸至海德鲁，以 US-66/SH-1 为终点。
In 1955, SH-19 was established through southern Caddo County, taking over the east–west section of SH-58.	SH-19 建于 1955 年，贯穿卡多县南部，接管了 SH-58 的东西段。
Thus, SH-58 was truncated to where it intersected with SH-19 (the present day western end of their concurrency).	因此，SH-58 在与 SH-19 交汇处（如今为它们的共同西端点）截断。
SH-58 was extended to its present terminus north of Hydro the next year.	次年，SH-58 延伸至位于海德鲁北部的当前终点。
The highway was further extended in 1964, bringing the southern terminus to its present location near Medicine Park.	高速公路于 1964 年进一步延长，将南终点带到了如今的医药公园附近位置。
No further routing changes have occurred since then.	此后没有发生过进一步路线变更。
Live at Wembley was filmed at the London's Wembley Arena show of the Dangerously in Love Tour, Beyoncé's first international solo tour, on November 10, 2003.	2003 年 11 月 10 日，伦敦温布利体育馆放映的《濒危爱情之旅》中播放了《温布利的生活》，这是碧昂斯的第一次国际独自旅行。
The tour supported her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003).	这次旅行让她出版了首张专辑《濒危爱情》（2003 年）。
Most of the songs on Live at Wembley originate from that album, but it also contains a medley of past songs by her former group Destiny's Child and two soundtrack singles: "Work It Out" and "Summertime".	《温布利的生活》中的大多数歌曲都是都源自该专辑，但还包含她前一组 Destiny's Child 中的歌曲以及两首原声单曲：“Work It Out”和“Summertime”。

The concert audio was mixed by Rick Camp, the same engineer who mixed at the concert venues.	演唱会音频由雷克-坎普合成，他也是负责音乐会现场混音的工程师。
It is uncommon for mix engineers to specialize in both live and recorded mixing.	在现场和录音混音两方面都擅长的混音工程师很少。
For Camp, "Mixing Beyoncé is a pleasure because she's a real singer and makes it easy.	对坎普来说，“为碧昂斯混音很愉快，因为她是一个真正的歌手，所以混音很简单。
There is hardly an overdub on this project — it's 95 percent live Beyoncé." He further talked about the collaboration with Beyoncé with Mix magazine, saying: "In my 22 years of mixing, I've never come across anyone who could deliver like she does: vocally and her ability to do a show.	这个项目几乎没有原带加录 — 95% 都是碧昂斯的现场演唱。”他进一步谈到了与碧昂斯在《Mix》杂志中的合作，说：“在我 22 年的混音生涯中，从来没有遇到这样出色的歌手：她的声音和表演能力令人难以置信。
I've seen this young woman run across a 60-foot stage, hit every note and never miss a thing.	我看到这位年轻的女士在 60 英尺的舞台上，每一个音准都把握到位，从来没有错过。
And that makes my job so much easier."	这样我们的工作就变得非常简单。”
On stage, Beyoncé was backed by several male and female dancers performing choreography during the show.	在舞台上表演时，有几个男女舞蹈演员为碧昂斯伴舞。
DJ Diamond who served as a DJ during the performances and a backing band provided the music.	DJ 戴蒙德在表演时担任 DJ，伴奏乐队提供音乐。
The performance starts with footage of the crowd during the concert cheering before the appearance of Beyoncé.	表演开始时，是碧昂斯出场前现场观众欢呼的镜头。
The curtains are lifted to reveal the stage and Beyoncé appears in red clothes hanging upside down while being taken to a sofa on the stage with a harness singing "Baby Boy".	帘幕升起，现出舞台，碧昂斯一袭红衣倒垂，一边唱着“Baby Boy”，一边被安全带引向舞台上的沙发。
She is backed by a big screen and several dancers on stage who perform a choreography around her.	她背后是一个大屏幕，舞台上有几名舞蹈演员伴舞。
She later starts dancing with them as the song plays and a breakdown towards the end is also featured.	后来在歌曲播放时，她开始与舞蹈演员共舞，并以跺脚曳步舞一直到结束。
She asks from the girls in the crowd to sing to "Naughty Girl" as she dances with background dancers while the words "Naughty Girl" are displayed on the screen behind her.	当她与后台舞蹈演员共舞时，观众中有女孩要她唱“Naughty Girl”，同时她身后的屏幕上显示“Naughty Girl”。
Towards the end of the song she performs portions of Vanity 6's song "Nasty Girl" (1982) as a short dance break.	在歌曲快要结束时，舞蹈之间有一个短暂的休息，她演唱了 Vanity 6 的歌曲“Nasty Girl”(1982) 的一部分。
The lights are turned off and later silhouettes of Beyoncé and her dancers appear performing a choreography in front of the screen which is colored white while a backing track is played.	灯光熄灭，碧昂斯和伴舞的身影显现，在白色的荧屏前跳舞，同时播放伴奏曲。
Stelmach's policy on health care was highlighted by his removal of the province's health care premiums effective the end of 2008.	从 2008 年底开始取消省内医疗保险费，突出了施特默对于医疗保健的政策。
Critics had denounced the premiums as being regressive, both because they were the same amount regardless of the payer's income and because people with better-paying jobs often had their premiums covered by their employer.	批评家谴责保险费是退步，因为无论支付者的收入为何，缴纳的金额都一样，而且工资高的人通常会有雇主给他们支付保险费。
The opposition Liberal and New Democratic parties had long called for their removal.	对立的自由党和新民党都一直呼吁取消保险费。
This elimination was announced in a throne speech immediately before the dissolution of the legislature for the 2008 election, although it was initially promised to take effect by 2012.	在 2008 年立法会选举解散之前的施政报告中宣布取消保险费，但最初承诺在 2012 年之前生效。
During this campaign, Stelmach promised to increase the capacity of Alberta universities to train doctors and nurses over four years, eventually resulting in the graduation of 225 more doctors, 350 more registered nurses, and 220 licensed practical nurses.	在此活动期间，施特默承诺阿尔伯特大学将会扩招，以培训四年制的医生和护士，最终多输送 225 名医生、350 名注册护士和 220 名持证实习护士。
After the registrar of the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons called the plan unfeasible, Health Minister Dave Hancock clarified that most of the increase would in fact come from the immigration of foreign doctors to Alberta, rather than from in-province training.	在阿尔伯特医科大学注册主任表示计划不可行之后，卫生部长戴夫-汉考克澄清，大多数增长实际会来自外籍医生移民到阿尔伯特，而不是省内培训。
Following the election, Stelmach's new Minister of Health, Ron Liepert, released the government's new health plan.	在选举后，施特默的新任卫生部长润-利伯特发布了政府的新健康计划。
In it, Liepert refused to characterize the problems in the health care system as being the result of doctor shortages, and instead promised structural reforms.	其中，利伯特拒绝将健康保健系统的问题归为医生短缺的结果，而承诺进行结构性的改革。
He indicated that these may include consolidating health authorities, closing rural hospitals, and de-listing some health services from coverage under the province's public health insurance scheme.	他表示，这些可能包括合并卫生机构、关闭农村医院，以及从省公共医疗保险方案中删除一些给付的医疗服务。
In May, the government took the first step in implementing these structural reforms by combining the province's nine health authorities into one health "superboard".	五月，政府将省九个卫生机构合并为一个卫生“超级委员会”，迈出了结构性改革的第一步。
In June 2008, three senior health officials announced that they would be leaving the province's employment at the expiration of their contracts in August.	2008 年 6 月，三名资深的卫生官员宣布，他们将在八月份合同到期后离开省卫生机构。
Liepert blamed their departures on better offers from other employers, although New Democrat leader Brian Mason speculated that the government's health restructuring may have been to blame.	利伯特责备他们是因其他雇主提供更好的待遇而辞职，但新民党领导人布莱恩-梅森猜测政府的卫生机构重组可能是罪魁祸首。
Detractors pointed out that the optics of allowing the employees to depart for more money elsewhere soon after the government had approved a substantial pay hike for cabinet ministers were not good.	恶意批评者指出，在政府批准为内阁大臣加薪后不久又批评雇员离职到其他地方谋求高薪是不道德的。
As the province's fiscal situation worsened in late 2008, the government adapted its health policy.	在 2008 年后期，随着省财政状况的恶化，政府调整了卫生政策。
In December, Liepert announced a new seniors drug plan that made drugs free for seniors making less than $21,325 but required those making more to pay as much as $7,500 for their drugs.	十二月，利伯特颁布了新的老年人药物计划，为收入低于 $21,325 的老年人提供免费药物，但收入高的需要为药物支付高达 $7,500。
In response to protests from seniors, he amended the plan in April 2009 to reduce both the income level at which seniors would have to start paying and the amount which those seniors would have to pay.	为回应老年人的抗议，他在 2009 年 4 月修订了计划，降低了老年人开始支付的收入水平标准，以及这些老年人必须支付的金额。
Liepert said that the plan, $10 million more expensive than the one he had announced in December, would see 60% of seniors pay less than they did under the status quo.	利伯特说，这个计划比他在十二月份宣布的计划要多支出 1 千万美元，60% 的老年人会比目前支付更少的费用。
The same month, Stelmach's government's budget revealed changes to which medical services it would cover: those de-listed included chiropractic services, at an annual savings of $53 million, and sex change operations, at an annual savings of $700,000.	当月，施特默的政府预算显示了其涵盖的医疗服务的变化：剔出名单的包括脊椎指压按摩服务，每年可节省 5300 万美元，以及变性手术，每年可节省 70 万美元。
While the Canada Health Act requires the federal government to financially penalize provinces that do not support all "medically necessary" procedures, Liepert maintained that the de-listed services were not "medically necessary" from the perspective of the Act, and said that he anticipated no trouble from the federal government.	虽然《加拿大卫生法案》要求联邦政府从财政上处罚不支持所有“医疗必需”程序的省份，但利伯特坚称剔出名单的服务从法案的角度来看不是“医疗必需”，并且预计联邦政府不会找麻烦。
During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Stelmach initially announced that the government would make the vaccine available to all Albertans, though vaccine shortages resulted in a limited number of clinics, which experienced long lineups.	2009 年 H1N1 疫情期间，施特默最初宣布，政府将为所有阿尔伯特人提供疫苗，虽然疫苗的短缺导致了诊所不足，人们要排很长的队。
Wright died at home in London of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65.	2008 年 9 月 15 日，怀特因癌症死于伦敦的家中，享年 65 岁。
At the time of his death, he had been working on a new solo album, which was thought to comprise a series of instrumental pieces.	直到他去世，他一直在致力于新的个人专辑，据说其中包含一系列器乐。
The surviving members of Pink Floyd paid Wright tribute.	平克-弗洛伊德的其他成员向怀特致敬。
Waters said "it is hard to overstate the importance of his musical voice in the Pink Floyd of the '60s and '70s" and was happy that they had managed to reunite for Live 8. Mason said Wright's contributions to Floyd were under-rated, and that his playing "was the sound that knitted it all together", comparing his "quiet one" status in the band to George Harrison.	沃特斯说“他动听的声音对 60 和 70 年代的平克-弗洛伊德的重要性难以估量”，并且对他们因 Live 8 重新聚到一起感到高兴。梅森说怀特对弗洛伊德的贡献被低估了，他的演奏“是集大成的声音”，将他在乐队中的“安静的一个”身份比作乔治-哈里森。
Gilmour called him "my musical partner and my friend", praised the ability of the two men's voices to blend, such as on "Echoes".	吉尔莫称他为“我的音乐伙伴，我的朋友”，赞扬了他混合两个男人的声音的能力，例如在“Echoes”中。
Wright's death brought Pink Floyd to a formal end, with Gilmour re-iterating that it would be wrong to resume touring without him.	怀特的去世宣告平克-弗洛伊德正式终止，吉尔莫反复说，没有了怀特，继续巡回演出是错误的。
On the day of Wright's death, Elton John, while playing a concert in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada dedicated the song "Believe" to him.	在怀特去世的当天，正在加拿大萨斯喀彻温萨斯卡通演奏音乐会的艾尔顿-约翰为他献上歌曲“Believe”。
On 23 September, Gilmour performed "Remember a Day", a Wright composition from Pink Floyd's second album, A Saucerful of Secrets, on a live broadcast of Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two as a tribute to Wright.	9 月 23 日，吉尔莫表演了“Remember a Day”，这是怀特在平克-弗洛伊德的第二张专辑 A Saucerful of Secrets 中的作品，后来与朱尔斯-霍兰德在 BBC Two 上现场直播，向怀特致敬。
In an interview later on in the show, Gilmour said that Wright had intended to perform with him that day, but that he had texted Gilmour a couple of weeks before his death to advise him that he would not be well enough to attend.	后来在节目中采访时，吉尔莫说怀特本计划当天与他一起表演，但他在去世前几个星期给吉尔莫发了一条信息，表示健康状况使得他无法参加。
Wright's main influence was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane.	怀特的主要影响力是爵士乐，特别是迈尔士-戴维斯和约翰-柯川。
He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of music with a theme, later saying "if the words came out like the music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written".	他从来没有将自己看作是一个典型的作曲家，更喜欢创作整张某一主题的音乐专辑，后来他说“如果说出来的话像音乐，我们就没有其他的事要做，只需要写下来就行”。
A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates.	怀特的很多作品来自于即兴创作和随机的想法，有些是他的乐队成员热心发现的。
Wright later said "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen".	怀特后来说“我只是在玩，没有细想过我在做什么，顺其自然而已”。
Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.	在所有平克-弗洛伊德成员中，怀特是最少言寡语的，总是坐在键盘后面专注于音乐。
In the 1970s, Wright listened to some contemporary progressive rock bands, and particularly liked early Peter Gabriel-fronted Genesis.	在 1970 年代，怀特听了一些当代新潮摇滚乐队的演奏，尤其是早期的彼得-盖布维尔面对的 Genesis。
He later asked some of the musicians in Gabriel's solo touring band to play on Broken China.	他后来要求 Gabriel 巡回表演乐队的一些音乐家在 Broken China 演奏。
Wright enjoyed playing the organ, and considered the style he used in Pink Floyd to be unique.	怀特喜欢演奏管风琴，认为他在平克-弗洛伊德采用的风格是独一无二的。
He played solos in the early part of Floyd's career, frequently using Egyptian scales, such as on "Matilda Mother" or "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun".	他在弗洛伊德职业生涯早期是独奏，经常使用埃及音阶，例如在“Matilda Mother”或“Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun”中。
His jazz background led to him being interested in free form music, with adherence to tempo being less important.	爵士乐背景让他对自由形式的音乐感兴趣，在他看来，节奏不那么重要。
Later, he was more interested in complementing each piece with organ, electric piano or synthesizer as a backing instrument, while still featuring occasional solos.	后来，他更有兴趣使用管风琴、电子钢琴或合成器作为支持乐器来补充每个部分，偶尔仍然会独奏。
Production on the episode began on September 14, 2004, and ran through to September 22.	剧集的制作始于 2004 年 9 月 14 日，持续到 9 月 22 日。
The standing sets were used for the first three days of filming.	常备的布景配置用于前三天的拍摄。
Further sets were created to represent the Vulcan Embassy and portions of the Forge.	为呈现 Vulcan Embassy 和 Forge 部分，创建了更多布景配置。
The final two days were filmed on site in Simi Valley in southern California, which doubled as the main areas of the Forge.	最后两天在南加利福尼亚的 Simi 山谷现场拍摄，那里还可以被当作 Forge 的主要区域。
The property used in the valley was owned by mining company P.W. Gillibrand, which was near property owned by Vulcan Materials Company.	山谷中使用地产归矿业公司 P.W. Gillibrand 所有，靠近 Vulcan Materials 公司的地产。
Optical effects were added to represent the firestorm and the sehlat.	为呈现风暴和泰迪熊，加入了光学特效。
The CGI sehlat was based on one which previously appeared in Star Trek: The Animated Series episode "Yesteryear".	CGI 泰迪熊基于以前出现在 Star Trek：动画系列剧集“Yesteryear”中的形象。
Visual effects producer Dan Curry said that the team "looked at the animated series and it just looked nice and pleasant, so I did a couple of sketches to do a reinterpretation of it to make it look scary, but not be too radical a departure from the original".	视觉特效制作人丹-柯瑞说，摄制组“看了这部系列动画片，看起来很漂亮，令人很愉快，于是我做了几幅草图，想将其重新诠释为看起来很可怕的样子，但没有过于偏离原创”。
Eden FX modelled the CGI under supervision by staff visual effects supervisor Art Codron.	Eden FX 的视觉特效主管亚特-柯德龙的监督下做了 CGI 模型。
Additional care was taken to create the fur so that close-ups could be used if required.	在制作皮毛的视觉效果时特别小心，因此在需要时可能会使用镜头特写。
The only physical portion of the sehlat to be created was a single paw. "Yesteryear" was set in the Vulcan city Shi'Khar, which reappears in "The Forge", and it is also the first mention of the area on Vulcan called the Forge.	要制作的泰迪熊唯一的实物部分是一个爪子。“Yesteryear”是在 Vulcan 市 Shi'Khar 拍摄的，在“The Forge”再次出现，它也是 Vulcan 中第一个提到的地区，称之为 Forge。
A further reference was made to "Vulcan's Forge" in the Deep Space Nine episode "Change of Heart".	此外，还参考了 Deep Space Nine 剧集“Change of Heart”中的“Vulcan's Forge”。
"The Forge" and the following two episodes make reference to a time of savagery in Vulcan history known as the "Time of Awakening".	“The Forge”和随后的两个剧集参考了 Vulcan 历史上称为“觉醒时代”的原始时期。
This had been previously mentioned in the original series episodes "Balance of Terror", "All Our Yesterdays", and "The Savage Curtain", as well as The Next Generation episode "Gambit".	这之前在原始系列剧集“Balance of Terror”、“All Our Yesterdays”和“The Savage Curtain”以及 The Next Generation 剧集“Gambit”中提到过。
The story mentioned the Vulcan T'Pau, who had previously appeared in The Original Series episode "Amok Time" presiding over the fight between Kirk and Spock, with the elder T'Pau portrayed by Celia Lovsky. Michael Reilly Burke returns as Koss, having previously appeared in the role in the season-four episode "Home".	故事提到了 Vulcan T'Pau，他之前也在原创系列剧集“Amok Time”中出现过，主持柯克与斯波克之间的战斗，还有西利亚-洛夫斯基描绘的长者 T'Pau。Michael Reilly Burke 作为 Koss 回来，之前出现在第四季剧集“Home”中。

After reading an article about the iLoo, Andrew Cubitt, inventor of the similarly named i-Loo, wrote to The Inquirer stating that iLoo "sounds remarkably similar ... it now seems that the clever people at Microsoft have cottoned onto the idea and even call it the i-Loo, the same as mine!" Cubitt went on to say that "mine did everything that the Microsoft one is meant to do, but additionally printed information on toilet paper and didn't use a keyboard for the interface due to hygiene reasons".	在阅读一篇关于 iLoo 的文章后，i-Loo 的发明者 Andrew Cubitt 写信给《问询报》，称 iLoo“听起来非常相似... 现在看来，微软的聪明人已经接受了这个想法，甚至把它叫做 i-Loo，和我的叫法一样！”Cubitt 接着说到：“我的 i-Loo 做了微软所要做的一切，但对于另外在卫生纸上打印信息这件事，出于卫生原因，没有使用键盘作为界面。”
The i-Loo was prototyped by Cubitt as part of his thesis for his 2001 university degree in Product Design and Engineering at Brunel University.	i-Loo 的原型设计由 Cubitt 完成，这是他 2001 年在布鲁内尔大学产品设计和工程专业的大学毕业论文的一部分。
In an interview with The Inquirer, he noted "As it was designed at the university, they own the partial rights to the product so they will be watching the Microsoft 'invention' very closely."	在接受《问询报》采访时，他指出：“由于它是在大学里设计的，他们拥有这个产品的部分权利，因此他们将密切关注微软的‘发明’。”
Microsoft never formally commented on Cubitt's allegations and instead initially stated the iLoo was an April's fool joke.	微软从未对 Cubitt 的指控作出正式评论，而是最初表示 iLoo 是一个四月的愚人节玩笑。
As a result, Cubitt questioned whether this was "a very calculated ploy to destroy competition in its early stages, or is admitting they don't even know what time of the month it is less embarrassing and ridding them of a potentially expensive situation!" Cubitt went on to state that "as they have now discredited my idea as a joke, I will never be able to produce the idea" and as such was "consulting my law books now on defamatory statements".	因此，Cubitt 质疑这是否是“一个精心策划的计策，目的是在早期阶段破坏竞争，还是承认他们甚至不知道现在是哪个月的哪一天，这样就不会如此尴尬了，而且还能让他们摆脱可能产生巨大成本的局面！”Cubitt 接着说：“因为他们现在已经把我的想法当作一个笑话来加以诋毁，我将永远无法产生这个想法”，因此，“我正在查阅关于诽谤性声明的法律书籍”。
Neither Cubitt, nor Brunel University have taken public legal action against Microsoft pertaining to the i-Loo.	无论是 Cubitt 还是布鲁内尔大学，都没有对微软采取与 i-Loo 有关的公开法律行动。
The i-Loo was described as:	i-Loo 的描述是：

On November 1, 2017, a controversy arose as the University of Wrocław took no action to pay for his grave to keep it until 2022 in face of its expiration because it supposedly "had no money".	2017 年 11 月 1 日，弗罗茨瓦夫大学没有采取行动为他的坟墓付钱以便使其保留到 2022 年，这引发了一场争议，因为据称它“没有钱”。
Mayor Rafał Dutkiewicz was also widely criticized for doing nothing.	市长 Rafał Dutkiewicz 也因无所作为而受到广泛批评。
Random people organized a charity and paid for the grave to remain.	一些陌生人组建了一个慈善机构，为保留坟墓支付了相应的费用。
Born in Forbes, New South Wales, on 27 February 1903, Lester Brain was the second son of an English mining engineer and manager, Austin Brain, and his Australian wife, Katie.	莱斯特·布瑞恩于 1903 年 2 月 27 日出生在新南威尔士州的福布斯，他是英国采矿工程师兼经理奥斯汀·布瑞恩和他的澳大利亚妻子凯蒂的次子。
Originally from Gloucestershire, Austin had emigrated with his parents and siblings in 1885, prospecting for gold in the United States before settling in Australia.	奥斯汀来自格洛斯特郡，1885 年与父母和兄弟姐妹移民美国开始勘探黄金，之后在澳大利亚定居。
By the age of thirteen, Lester owned his own motorcycle bought secondhand for £11; its poor condition and constant need for repair helped him become mechanically adept at an early age.	在十三岁的时候，莱斯特花 11 英镑买了一辆二手摩托车；这辆摩托车的糟糕状况和不断的维修需求让他在很小的时候就成为了机械高手。
He completed his education at Sydney Grammar School, where he excelled in maths, before being employed by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (CBC) in 1919.	他在悉尼文法学校完成学业，数学成绩优异，随后于 1919 年入职悉尼商业银行 (CBC)。
Brain's penchant for motorbikes and things mechanical inspired a lift driver at CBC to suggest he apply for pilot training in the recently formed Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).	布瑞恩对摩托车和机械设备的爱好启发了 CBC 的一名电梯司机，这位司机建议他申请参加最近成立的澳大利亚皇家空军 (RAAF) 的飞行员训练。
He was among five civilian students nominated by the Civil Aviation Branch (CAB) of the Defence Department for entry into the inaugural RAAF flying training course, which commenced at Point Cook, Victoria in January 1923.	他是国防部民航部门 (CAB) 提名的 5 名平民学生之一，参加了 RAAF 的首次飞行训练课程，这门课程于 1923 年 1 月在维多利亚库克角开始。
The benefit of these nominations from a military perspective was that although the destiny of the CAB-sponsored students was to be civil aviators, they would also be members of the RAAF reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF), and could therefore be called up for active service as and when necessary.	从军事角度看，这些提名的好处在于，尽管 CAB 资助的学生的命运是成为民用飞行员，但他们也是 RAAF 的预备队成员，被称为公民空军 (CAF)，因此在必要时可以被征召服役。
Brain's fellow attendees included Royal Australian Navy lieutenants Joe Hewitt and Ellis Wackett, and Australian Army lieutenant Frank Bladin, all of whom were seconded—and later permanently transferred—to the RAAF.	布瑞恩的同学包括澳大利亚皇家海军中尉乔·休伊特和埃利斯·瓦克特，以及澳大利亚陆军中尉弗兰克·布莱丁，他们都曾被借调到 RAAF，后来则被永久调任。
Brain graduated at the top of his class after the year-long training course at Point Cook, and was duly commissioned in the CAF.	在库克角接受了一年的训练课程后，布瑞恩以全班第一名的成绩毕业，并在 CAF 获得正式任命。
Moving to Queensland in April 1924, he took up employment as a pilot with Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services (Qantas), its first aviator without a war record.	1924 年 4 月，他来到昆士兰，在昆士兰和北领地航空服务公司 (Qantas) 担任飞行员，这是该公司第一位没有战争记录的飞行员。
On 7 February 1925, he flew the first scheduled passenger service from Cloncurry to Camooweal, extending the airline's founding 580-mile (930 km) route—from Charleville to Cloncurry—by 284 miles (457 km).	1925 年 2 月 7 日，他首次从克朗克里飞往卡穆威尔，将这家航空公司创立时的 580 英里（930 公里）航线（从查尔维尔到克朗克里）延长了 284 英里（457 公里）。
The following year, he completed a refresher course at Central Flying School, Point Cook.	第二年，他在库克角的中央飞行学校完成了进修课程。
On a rain-soaked McKinlay airfield near Cloncurry on 27 February 1927, he flipped Qantas' first de Havilland DH.50 on to its back while attempting take-off, though he managed to escape without injury.	1927 年 2 月 27 日，在克朗克里附近一个被雨水浸透的麦金利机场，他在尝试起飞时将澳洲航空公司的第一架 De Havilland DH.50 型飞机翻转了 180°，不过他最终成功逃脱，没有受伤。
Qantas founder Hudson Fysh berated him for a "serious error of judgement", but noted his excellent three-year record as a pilot; the aircraft was soon repaired and operational again.	澳洲航空公司创始人哈德逊·费什斥责他“判断严重失误”，但注意到他三年来作为飞行员的出色记录；这架飞机很快就被修好并重新投入使用。
The next month, Brain became Chief Instructor at the Qantas Flying School in Brisbane, doubling as manager of the airline's local office.	接下来的一个月，布瑞恩成为澳洲航空公司布里斯班飞行学校的首席讲师，兼任该航空公司当地办公室的经理。
By mid-1928, he had overworked himself to the extent that he was ordered to take respite by Fysh; this "respite" nevertheless involved a 13-week trip to England to study aviation developments.	1928 年中期，他工作劳累过度，费什命令他休息一下；然而，这次“休息”却带来了一次为期 13 周的英国航空发展研究之旅。
In April 1929, Brain was selected to take part in a search for lost aviators in northern Australia, having gained experience of the area while flying over the Tanami Desert to assist a gold prospecting expedition some years earlier.	1929 年 4 月，布莱恩被选中参加在澳大利亚北部寻找失踪飞行员的行动。几年前，他在飞越塔纳米沙漠协助一支淘金探险队时，获得了与该地区相关的经验。
On 20 April, he took Qantas DH.50 Atalanta from Brisbane to link up with RAAF Airco DH.9s under the command of Flight Lieutenant Charles Eaton at Tennant Creek, to look for Keith Anderson and Robert Hitchcock in their Westland Widgeon the Kookaburra.	4 月 20 日，他从布里斯班乘坐澳洲航空公司亚特兰大 DH.50 型飞机，在滕南特克里克与 RAAF Airco DH.9s 型飞机汇合，由空军上尉查尔斯·伊顿指挥，去寻找驾驶 Westland Widgeon 型飞机（笑翠鸟号）的飞行员基思·安德森和罗伯特·希区柯克。
The pair had disappeared while searching for Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm, who had been reported missing on a record attempt from Sydney to England in the Southern Cross.	这对夫妇是在寻找查尔斯·金斯福德·史密斯和查尔斯·乌尔姆时失踪的，根据报告，他们在失踪前曾驾驶南十字星号从悉尼飞往到英国，试图创造一个纪录。
Brain located the Kookaburra the next day in the Tanami Desert, approximately 130 kilometres (81 mi) east-south-east of Wave Hill.	第二天，布瑞恩在塔纳米沙漠里找到了笑翠鸟号，具体位于韦夫希尔东南偏东约 130 公里（81 英里）处。
Galadriel was originally named Artanis (Q. 'ar'=noble, 'nis'=woman, a name common to royal women of the Elves, most prominently as in the form Arwen, Galadriel's granddaughter), and Nerwen (Q. 'ner'=man, 'wen'=maiden, hence manly maiden), referring to her height and strength; Galadriel is the Sindarinized version of Telerin Quenya Alatáriel (Q. 'alatá'=radiance, 'riel'=maiden crowned with a garland), a name given her by Celeborn, referring to her silver-golden hair.	凯兰崔尔的原名是阿塔尼斯（Q. 'ar'=高贵，'nis'=女人，这是一个精灵中王室女性的常见名字，最著名的是凯兰崔尔的孙女亚玟）和诺玟（Q. 'ner'=男人，'wen'=少女，因此意思是有男子气概的少女)，指的是她的身高和力量；凯兰崔尔是 Telerin Quenya Alatáriel 的辛达林版本（Q. 'alatá'=光辉，'riel'=戴着花环的少女），这是凯勒鹏给她取的名字，指的是她那银金色的头发。
The name Galadhriel (S. 'galadh'=tree, 'riel'=crowned maiden) was used outside Lórien by the people who did not know the ancient days and Galadriel's history, confusing galad with the Sindarin word galadh and the name of the Galadhrim, the people of Lórien.	在洛立安外面，不了解古代和凯兰崔尔历史的人使用凯兰崔尔（S. 'galadh'=树，'riel'=戴皇冠的少女）这个名字，他们把加拉德 (Galad) 和辛达林语的 galadh 以及洛立安人凯兰崔尔的名字搞混了。
As the ruler of Lothlórien, she was referred to by a variety of titles, including "Lady of Lórien", "Lady of the Wood", and (by Gimli) "Queen Galadriel"—although, according to Tolkien's account in Unfinished Tales, neither she nor Celeborn took royal titles themselves, as they considered themselves merely guardians of Lórien.	作为罗斯洛立安的统治者，她被冠以各种各样的头衔，包括“洛立安的夫人”、“丛林夫人”和“凯兰崔尔女王”（被金利这样称呼）— 尽管根据托尔金在《未完成的故事》中的描述，她和凯勒鹏都没有获得皇室头衔，因为他们认为自己只是洛立安的守护者。
She was also referred to as "Lady of Light" (the translation of Galadriel) or as the "White Lady", as her fair skin and white cloaks made her seem to shine.	她也被称为“光之女神”或“白夫人”，因为她白皙的皮肤和白色的斗篷让她看起来熠熠生辉。
It was said (by the Dúnedain) that her height was two rangar (Quenya: 'strides'), or "man-high" – about 6 ft. 4 in., or 193 cm.	据登丹人说，她的身高是 2 rangar（昆雅语：“步幅”），或者“男人的身高”– 大约 6 英尺 4 英寸或 193 公分。
However, Galadriel's most striking feature is her beautiful long silver-golden hair.	然而，凯兰崔尔最引人注目的特征是她那美丽的银金色长发。
The Elves of Tirion said it captured the radiance of the Two Trees Laurelin and Telperion themselves.	提理安的精灵们说，它捕捉到了双圣树罗瑞林和泰尔佩瑞安本身的光芒。
Even among the Eldar she was accounted beautiful, and her hair is held a marvel unmatched.	即使在精灵中，她也是公认的美人，她的头发也被视为无与伦比的奇迹。
It is golden like the hair of her father and of her foremother Indis, but richer and more radiant, for its gold is touched by some memory of the starlike silver of her mother; and the Eldar say that the light of the Two Trees, Laurelin and Telperion, has been snared in her tresses.	她的头发是金色的，就像她父亲和她的祖先茵迪丝的头发一样，但更丰润、更有光泽，因为她的金色被她母亲星银般的记忆所触动；精灵们说，双圣树罗瑞林和泰尔佩瑞安的光芒已经被她的发丝捕捉。
It was greatly admired by Fëanor and may have inspired him to create the Silmarilli.	这受到了费诺的极度推崇，也许正是它激发了他创作“精灵宝钻”的灵感。
Many thought that this saying first gave to Fëanor the thought of imprisoning and blending the light of the Trees that later took shape in his hands as the Silmarils.	许多人认为，这句话首先给了费诺禁锢和融合圣树之光的想法，后来才经由他手打造成“精灵宝钻”。
For Fëanor beheld the hair of Galadriel with wonder and delight.	因为费诺看到凯兰崔尔的头发时又惊奇又高兴。
Nevertheless, she never repaid Fëanor's admiration with the generosity she showed to Gimli the Dwarf in The Fellowship of the Ring.	然而，她从未像《指环王》中对矮人金利那样慷慨地回报过费诺的钦佩之情。
Fëanor "had begged her thrice for a tress and thrice she refused to give him even one hair.	费诺曾三次求她给他一根头发，但她三次都拒绝给他哪怕一根头发。
It is said that these two kinsfolk, being considered the greatest of the Eldar of Valinor, remain unfriends forever."	据说这两个亲属被认为是维林诺最伟大的精灵，永远是朋友。”
Her character was similarly a blend of characteristics of the kindreds of the Eldar from whom she was descended.	同样，她的性格也融合了她的祖先精灵族的特点。
She had the pride and ambition of the Noldor, but in her they were tempered by the gentleness and insight of the Vanyar.	她有诺多族的骄傲和野心，但在她身上，这些却被梵雅族的温柔和洞察力所调和。
She shared the latter virtues of character with her father Finarfin and her brother Finrod.	她与她的父亲费纳芬和哥哥芬罗德都有着同样的品格美德。
She was proud, strong, and self-willed, as were all the descendants of Finwë save Finarfin; and like her brother Finrod, of all her kin the nearest to her heart, she had dreams of far lands and dominions that might be her own to order as she would without tutelage.	她骄傲、坚强、倔强，就像芬威的所有后裔一样，除了费纳芬；在她的所有亲人中，她的哥哥芬罗德离她的心最近，她也梦想着可以拥有自己的遥远土地和领土，不受任何人的监管。
Yet deeper still there dwelt in her the noble and generous spirit of the Vanyar, and a reverence for the Valar that she could not forget.	然而，在她的内心深处，却深藏着梵雅族高贵而慷慨的精神，她对梵雅族怀有一种无法忘怀的崇敬之情。
Kepler-10b's discovery excited astronomers, who hoped to use data about it to inquire into the formation and structure that terrestrial, Earth-size planets tend to have in common.	开普勒-10b 的发现让天文学家们兴奋不已，他们希望利用有关它的数据来探究类地行星和地球般大小的行星的形成和结构。
Geoff Marcy of the University of California at Berkeley said that the discovery was ranked "as among the most profound scientific discoveries in human history," and that the planet "will go into every textbook worldwide." Marcy also described Kepler-10b as "a bridge between the gas giant planets we've been finding and the Earth itself." Diana Valencia at the University of Côte d'Azur in Nice, France considered the planet more of a "super-Mercury" than a super-Earth, granted its physical characteristics.	加州大学伯克利分校的杰弗里·马西说，这一发现被列为“人类历史上影响最深远的科学发现之一”，这个星球“将进入全世界的每一本教科书”。马西还将开普勒-10b 描述为“我们一直在寻找的气态巨行星和地球自身之间的桥梁”。法国尼斯蔚蓝海岸大学的戴安娜·瓦伦西亚认为，根据其物理特性判断，这颗行星更像一颗“超级水星”，而不是一颗“超级地球”。
Kepler-10b is most noted for its rocky surface.	开普勒-10b 最引人注目的是其岩石表面。
It has a diameter 1.4 times that of the Earth, and a mass of 3.33±0.49 times that of Earth.	它的直径是地球的 1.4 倍，质量是地球的 3.33±0.49 倍。
The density of Kepler-10b is 5.8±0.8 g cm⁻³.	开普勒-10b 的密度为 5.8±0.8g cm-³。
It orbits its star, Kepler-10, in less than a day, at less than a twentieth of the distance from Mercury to the Sun.	它围绕其恒星开普勒-10 公转的时间不到一天，与母星的距离不到水星与太阳距离的二十分之一。
Its surface temperature on the star lit side is approximately 1833 K, which is as hot as a blast furnace and hot enough to melt iron.	它被恒星照射一侧的表面温度约为 1833 K，相当于高炉的温度，热到足以熔化铁。
Though CoRoT-7b was discovered before Kepler-10b and has been claimed to be rocky, there is more room for other interpretations in the case of CoRoT-7b's composition than there is for Kepler-10b.	尽管 CoRoT-7b 是在开普勒-10b 之前被发现的，并且一直被认为是岩石，但与开普勒-10b 相比，CoRoT-7b 的成分有更大的空间可以做出其他解释。
This is due to the much larger uncertainty in CoRoT-7b's mass (and, to a lesser extent, its radius) which is illustrated in the plot to the left.	这是由于 CoRoT-7b 的质量（在较小程度上，其半径）有着更大的不确定性，如左图所示。
Consequently, CoRoT-7b may be revealed to be a lava-ocean planet, whereas Kepler-10b must be predominantly made of rock or iron.	因此，CoRoT-7b 可能被发现是一颗熔岩-海洋行星，而开普勒-10b 的成分必定主要是岩石或铁。
In addition to showing the range of masses and radii consistent with the observations of each planet, the plot includes curves of compositions implied by certain masses and radii.	除了显示与观测结果一致的质量和半径范围外，这张图还包括由某些质量和半径所暗示的成分曲线。
Kepler-10b is tidally locked to its parent star and has extreme variations in temperature between day and night sides.	开普勒-10b 被潮汐力锁定到它的母星，其昼夜两侧的温度变化非常大。
It also reflects about half of the starlight it receives.	它还反射大约一半接收到的星光。
The writer for this episode, David A.	本集编剧：大卫·A。
Goodman, said that making this episode was a "dream come true" for many members of the crew including himself.	古德曼说，拍摄这一集对包括他自己在内的许多剧组成员来说是“梦想成真”。
At the time he was hired onto the staff, they were already talking about creating a Star Trek-centric episode.	在他加入剧组之时，他们已经在讨论打造一个以《星际迷航》为中心的剧集了。
The initial idea was to have a giant Kirk and Spock fighting over New York-New York Hotel and Casino.	最初的想法是让巨大的柯克和斯波克争夺纽约纽约赌场酒店。
Executive producer David X.	执行制片人：大卫·X。
Cohen assigned the writing task to Goodman, as they agreed he was the biggest Trek fan of the group.	科恩把编剧任务交给了古德曼，因为他们一致认为他是这群人中最忠实的《星际迷航》粉丝。
They agreed to drop the story idea with the giant characters and gave him two weeks to write the script.	他们同意放弃巨人角色的故事构思，并给他两周时间来写剧本。
The deadline was complicated as Goodman had to spend the first week on jury duty, and then broke his ankle.	最后期限相当紧张，因为古德曼不得不在第一周内履行陪审员职责，然后又摔断了脚踝。
Despite this, he described "Where No Fan Has Gone Before" as the most fun he has ever had writing a script.	尽管如此，他说《没有粉丝去过的地方》是他写剧本以来最有趣的一次。
Series creator Matt Groening stated that while he is a fan of the Star Trek franchise, he has never seen an episode of The Original Series in its entirety, but has seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.	该剧制片人马特·格勒宁表示，虽然他是《星际迷航》系列的粉丝，但他从来没有完整看过《星际迷航：原初系列》，但看过《星际迷航电影版》。
Director Pat Shinagawa said that there was a certain amount of jealousy among the crew that she got to work on the episode.	导演帕特品川表示，在她参与拍摄这一集的工作人员之间存在一定程度的嫉妒。
All of the living members of the original Star Trek cast agreed to appear in the episode with the exception of James Doohan, whose agent replied with "No way." Because of this, the episode's working title was jokingly named "We got everybody but Scotty" and so Scotty was replaced with "Welshie".	《星际迷航》中所有在世的演员都同意出演这一集，但詹姆斯·杜汉除外，他的经纪人回答说“不可能”。正因如此，这一集的暂定名称被戏称为“除了史考提，我们谁都有”，所以史考提被换成了“威尔士人”。
DeForest Kelley was physically portrayed but had no lines due to his death in 1999. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy recorded their lines together, which was unusual as actors usually record solo.	德福雷斯特·凯利亲自出演，但由于他已在 1999 年去世，因此没有任何台词。威廉·夏特纳和伦纳德·尼莫伊一起录制了他们的台词，这很不寻常，因为演员通常会单独录制。
Following his work on Futurama, Goodman went on to join the writing staff on Star Trek: Enterprise.	在完成《飞出个未来》的拍摄之后，古德曼加入了《星际迷航：企业号》的编剧团队。
A number of designs for the energy being were considered for this episode; however, the final version was decided upon due to a desire to keep the design simple.	这一集考虑了许多关于能量存在的设计；然而，由于希望保持设计的简单性，因此决定采用这个最终版本。
Shinagawa noted that even so, the final design for Melllvar is more sophisticated than some energy beings featured in the original series.	品川指出，即便如此，Melllvar 的最终设计也比原版系列中的一些能量生物更加复杂。
This episode contains many story elements based on episodes of Star Trek.	这一集包含许多基于《星际迷航》剧集的故事元素。
In the DVD audio commentary, Goodman noted his pride in having included a large number of quotations from The Original Series, particularly those items which he claims "the people on the internet" had not found on their own.	在 DVD 音频评论中，古德曼指出，他对收录了大量来自《原初系列》的语录感到自豪，特别是那些他称为“互联网上的人”自己找不到的内容。
He noted that in "Shatner's Log", based on Star Trek's "Captain's log", the line "The impossible has happened" quotes the opening log in "Where No Man Has Gone Before".	他指出，在根据《星际迷航》的《船长日志》改编的《夏特纳的日志》中，“不可能的事情发生了”这句话引用了“前人所未至的领域”的开篇日志。
Although the episode was not the last episode produced for season four, it was used as the season finale for the fourth broadcast season, being broadcast on April 21, 2002, on Fox in the United States.	虽然这一集不是第四季的最后一集，但在美国福克斯电视台于 2002 年 4 月 21 日播出时，它被用作第四季的大结局。
After returning from the United States after the launch of her debut studio album The Family Jewels (2010), Diamandis considered creating a character which would become the centerpiece of her follow-up project.	迪曼蒂斯在 2010 年推出了首张录音室专辑《The Family Jewels》，从美国返回后，她考虑创造一个将成为她后续项目核心的角色。
She commented that she was inspired by the "Tumblr generation" to photograph herself in several places across the United States, appearing as a different persona in each picture to mimick the anonymity of the "mini-stars of the internet".	她评论说，受“Tumblr 一代”的启发，她在美国各地拍摄了自己的照片，在每张照片中都以不同的身份出现，以模仿“互联网上的小小明星”的匿名身份。
The final product became "a cold, ruthless character who wasn't vulnerable", which she later named "Electra Heart" and detailed as a tool to represent a combination of elements associated with the American Dream and Greek tragedy, and added that visuals would merge the differing concepts into a cohesive idea.	最终的作品变成了“一个冷酷无情的角色，但并不脆弱”，她后来将其命名为“Electra Heart”，并详细解释这是一个代表与美国梦和希腊悲剧相关的元素组合的工具，此外她还补充说，视觉效果会将不同的概念合并成一个完整的想法。
Diamandis first announced Electra Heart in August 2011; it was initially planned to become a three-piece project inspired by American culture in the 1970s, although it eventually evolved into her second studio album.	2011 年 8 月迪曼蒂斯首次宣布推出《Electra Heart》；受 20 世纪 70 年代美国文化的启发，这首歌最初计划制作成三首歌，但最终演变成她的第二张录音室专辑。
Diamandis originally planned to release the record as a "side project" under an entity separate from Marina and the Diamonds, although her management disapproved.	迪曼蒂斯原本计划将这张专辑作为一个独立于 Marina And The Diamonds 的“副业项目”来发行，尽管她的管理层不同意这样做。
The track "Living Dead" was the first recorded during its production, and approximately 22 songs were recorded for potential inclusion on the album.	《活死人》是在其制作过程中录制的第一首歌曲，最后录制了大约 22 首有可能被收录到专辑中的歌曲。
She later commented that the record was dedicated to "dysfunctional love", elaborating that "rejection is a universally embarrassing topic and Electra Heart is my response to that." Diamandis stated that Electra Heart was influenced by Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, and Queen of France Marie Antoinette; she described Madonna as being "fearless" and felt that she showcased a desire to be a successful artist beyond fame and wealth.	她后来评论说，这张专辑是献给“不正常的爱”的，并解释说“被拒绝是一个普遍令人尴尬的话题，《Electra Heart》是我对此的回应。”迪曼蒂斯表示，《Electra Heart》受到了麦当娜、玛丽莲·梦露和法国王后玛丽·安托瓦内特的影响；她形容麦当娜“无所畏惧”，并认为她展现了一种成为超越名利的成功艺术家的愿望。
Diamandis told Glamour that Britney Spears influenced a "double-sided" theme for the record of both "innocence" and "darkness".	迪曼蒂斯告诉《Glamour》杂志，布兰妮·斯皮尔斯影响了同时记录“纯真”和“黑暗”的“双面”主题。
She described the final product as being "a bit cringe" and reflective of her personal experiences, although noted that its promotional campaign would be "pink and fluffy".	她形容最终作品“有点令人生厌”，这是她个人经历的反映，尽管她指出其宣传活动将是“粉红色和蓬松的”。
On 1 March, Diamandis unveiled the album artwork for the standard version of Electra Heart, which depicts a blonde Diamandis wearing several hair rollers.	3 月 1 日，迪曼蒂斯公布了《Electra Heart》标准版的专辑封面，画面上是金发的迪曼蒂斯戴着几个卷发器。
The singer later revealed that because of the dye, her hair started to fall out, so she got a boy's haircut and wore a wig.	这位歌手后来透露，因为染发，她的头发开始脱落，所以她剪了一个男孩的发型，戴了一顶假发。
Becky Bain from Idolator complimented its "retro film stock look" and opined that it "is just a snapshot from some 1970s exploitation movie", while Bradley Stern from MuuMuse jokingly referenced the album track "Homewrecker" when stating that she "looks like a proper Suzy Homemaker! (Or should I say Suzy Homewrecker?)" The artwork for the deluxe version features the same picture of Diamandis, although it is tinted purple.	来自 Idolator 的贝基·贝恩称赞它拥有“复古电影胶片的外观”，并认为它“只是 20 世纪 70 年代某部剥削电影的快照”，而来自 MuuMuse 的布拉德利·斯特恩则开玩笑地提到了专辑中的歌曲《Homewrecker》，说她“看起来像一个真正的家庭主妇苏西！”（或者我应该说第三者苏西？）”豪华版的插图拥有同样的迪曼蒂斯图片，尽管它呈现出紫色。
The track listing for the standard version was confirmed on 1 March, while the track listing for the deluxe version was announced on 5 March.	标准版的曲目列表在 3 月 1 日确认，而豪华版的曲目列表则在 3 月 5 日公布。
A limited edition box set of Electra Heart contained the deluxe version of the record, four photo art cards, a ring, perspex, necklace, and pocket mirror.	一套限量版的盒装《Electra Heart》包含豪华版唱片、四张照片艺术卡、一枚戒指、有机玻璃、项链和化妆镜。
Diamandis released 11 music videos through YouTube during the promotional campaign for Electra Heart.	在宣传《Electra Heart》期间，迪曼蒂斯在 YouTube 上发布了 11 个音乐视频。
She claimed that their production led her record label into bankruptcy, but stated that they would be released and "finish this era the way I want to." The first, titled "Part 1: Fear and Loathing", was released on 8 August 2011, and sees Diamandis cutting her long brown hair and singing the track on a balcony during the nighttime.	虽然她声称它们的制作导致她的唱片公司破产，但她表示，它们一定会发行，并“以我想要的方式结束这个时代。”第一张专辑名为《Part 1: Fear and Loathing》，于 2011 年 8 月 8 日发行，可以看到，迪曼蒂斯剪掉了她的棕色长发，在夜晚的阳台边唱着这首歌。
It was followed by "Part 2: Radioactive" on 22 August, which depicts a blonde-wigged Diamandis travelling across the United States with her romantic interest.	接下来是 8 月 22 日推出的《Part 2: Radioactive》，描绘了戴着金色假发的迪曼蒂斯与她的恋人一起穿越美国的故事。

During their casting meeting, Kitsis and Horowitz told de Ravin that Belle is defined as a strong intelligent woman in a world that disapproves of those characteristics, and that de Ravin was going to be "tak[ing] the icon of Belle and mak[ing] her a woman."	在选角会议上，基迪斯和霍罗威茨告诉德·拉文，贝拉被定义为一个强大而聪明的女人，而这个世界不喜欢这些特征，德·拉文将“把贝拉的形象塑造成一个女人。”
Espenson said that this was one of their most love-centered episodes; when they realized it was going to be airing near Valentine's Day, they decided to "lean into" this theme.	埃斯本森说，这是他们最以爱情为中心的一集；当他们意识到这一集将在情人节临近播出时，他们决定“融入”这一主题。
Unusually for Once Upon a Time, the theme of this episode changed during the writing process.	对于《童话镇》不同寻常的是，这一集的主题在编剧过程中发生了变化。
It was initially meant to center on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love.	它最初的主题是侏儒怪选择权力而不是爱情。
However, as Espenson went through drafts and discussed them with others, she decided that Rumpelstiltskin might think he is choosing power over love, but in reality his actions are motivated by a belief that he is worthy of love at all.	然而，当埃斯本森翻阅草稿并与他人探讨时，她认为侏儒怪可能认为自己选择了权力而不是爱情，但实际上他的行为出于一种信念，即他值得被爱。
In the interest of time, Espenson was forced to edit out many plot points, including a failed escape attempt by Belle.	为了节省时间，埃斯本森被迫删减了许多情节，包括贝拉一次失败的逃跑尝试。
Despite this, she sought to trim down more time from the Storybrooke scenes and "preserve as much as we could of the fairy tale side," as the Belle-Rumpelstiltskin relationship was a love story that needed time to grow in order to be believable.	尽管如此，她还是试图减少童话镇场景的时间，并“尽可能多地保留童话的一面”，因为贝拉与侏儒怪的关系是一个爱情故事，需要时间来发展才能令人信服。
De Ravin was a fan of the series before being cast and was happy to be able to view the costumes up close, describing her character's gold dress as "absolutely stunning." The casting of her former suitor, Gaston, was announced in December 2011 with Psych actor Sage Brocklebank.	在出演之前，德·拉文是这部连续剧的粉丝，她很高兴能够近距离观看戏服，称她所扮演角色的金色礼服“超级惊艳”。她的前追求者加斯顿的选角于 2011 年 12 月公布，由《灵异妙探》的演员塞奇·布洛克班克出演。
De Ravin described the episode's version of Gaston as "maybe not as cocky as the animation [version of him], but it’s funny." Rumpelstiltskin's castle was shot almost entirely on greenscreen, with only a few real props being used.	德·拉文将这一集的加斯顿描述为“也许不像动画版的加斯顿那样自大，但十分有趣。”侏儒怪的城堡几乎完全在绿幕上拍摄，只使用了一些真实道具。
It was de Ravin's first time working with this technology, which caused her to become "quite nervous." The physical props helped her with the scenes, and "they ha[d] a fantastic set up of a couple of monitors that you can see a markup of basically how it’s going to look."	这是德·拉文第一次使用这项技术，这让她变得“相当紧张”。实物道具帮助她应对各种场景，“他们安排了几台奇妙的显示器，你可以看到一个大体上展示场景看起来如何的标记。”
The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.	这一集被收录在 Hyperion Books 于 2013 出版的《再度觉醒：童话镇》（第一季的小说版）中。
There are multiple references made to Disney's Beauty and the Beast.	迪士尼的《美女与野兽》被多次引用。
The chipped tea cup that Belle accidentally drops is a reference to the boy-transformed-teacup Chip from the animated film.	贝拉不小心掉落的碎茶杯是指动画电影中那个男孩变身的茶杯奇普。
Also, Rumplestiltskin was referred to as a "beast" by Belle's father.	另外，侏儒怪也被贝拉的父亲称为“野兽”。
Belle's fiancée in the show is named Gaston, the Disney antagonist, and he was turned into a red rose, which featured prominently in the film.	剧中贝拉的未婚夫名字叫加斯顿，这是迪士尼的反派角色，他被变成了一朵红玫瑰，这段情节在电影中非常重要。
In addition, most of Belle's clothing in the fantasy world appears to be directly inspired by the Disney film, such as her classic yellow ballgown and her blue-and-white plainclothes.	此外，贝拉在幻想世界中的大部分服装似乎都是直接受到迪士尼电影的启发，比如她经典的黄色长舞裙和蓝白相间的便装。
