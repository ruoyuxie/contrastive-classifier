There were varying degrees of Romanization throughout Roman Dacia.	達契亞行省各處都有不同程度的羅馬化。
The most Romanized segment was the region along the Danube, which was predominately under imperial administration, albeit in a form that was partially barbarized.	最羅馬化的區段是多瑙河沿岸區域，這個區域過去主要受帝國統治，雖然有部分是以野蠻的形式來進行。
The population beyond this zone, having lived with the Roman legions before their withdrawal, were substantially Romanized.	超過此區域的人口因為曾在羅馬軍團撤退之前與軍團居住在一起，所以本質上相當羅馬化。
The final zone, consisting of the northern portions of Maramures, Crisana, and Moldavia, stood at the edges of Roman Dacia.	最後的區域，包括馬拉穆列什、克里沙那和摩達維亞的北邊部分，則是羅馬達契亞行省的邊緣。
Although its people did not have Roman legions stationed among them, they were still nominally under the control of Rome, politically, socially, and economically.	雖然其人民沒有羅馬軍團駐紮在其中，但在政治、社會和經濟方面，他們名義上仍受到羅馬控制。
These were the areas in which resided the Carpi, often referred to as the Free Dacians.	這些是經常被稱為自由達契亞人的卡爾皮人居住過的地區。
In an attempt to fill the cities, cultivate the fields, and mine the ore, a large-scale attempt at colonization took place with colonists coming in "from all over the Roman world".	隨著「來自羅馬世界各處」的開拓者嘗試填補城市、開墾野地和開採礦石，發生了殖民化的大規模攻佔。
The colonists were a heterogeneous mix: of the some 3,000 names preserved in inscriptions found by the 1990s, 74% (c. 2,200) were Latin, 14% (c. 420) were Greek, 4% (c. 120) were Illyrian, 2.3% (c. 70) were Celtic, 2% (c. 60) were Thraco-Dacian, and another 2% (c. 60) were Semites from Syria.	開拓者由不同的族裔混合組成：在 1990 年代找到的銘文所保存約 3,000 個名字中，有 74% (約 2,200 個) 是拉丁人，14% (約 420 個) 是希臘人，4% (約 120 個) 是伊利里亞人，2.3% (約 70 個) 是凱爾特人，2% (約 60 個) 是瑟雷斯達契亞人，還有其他 2% (約 60 個) 是來自敘利亞的閃米特人。
Regardless of their place of origin, the settlers and colonists were a physical manifestation of Roman civilisation and imperial culture, bringing with them the most effective Romanizing mechanism: the use of Latin as the new lingua franca.	無論移民者和開拓者的原居地為何，他們都是羅馬文明及帝國文化的具體展現，因為他們帶來了最有效的羅馬化機制：使用拉丁文作為新的通用語。
The first settlement at Sarmizegethusa was made up of Roman citizens who had retired from the legions.	薩爾米澤傑圖薩的第一批移民是由軍團退休的羅馬公民組成。
Based upon the location of names scattered throughout the province, it has been argued that, although places of origin are hardly ever noted in epigraphs, a large percentage of colonists originated from Noricum and western Pannonia.	有人認為，根據散佈在該省各處的名稱所在地點，雖然碑文中幾乎未曾註記過原居地，還是有很大比例的開拓者是源自諾里庫姆和西潘諾尼亞。
Specialist miners (the Pirusti tribesmen) were brought in from Dalmatia.	專業礦工 (皮魯斯蒂部落成員) 從達爾馬提亞引進。
These Dalmatian miners were kept in sheltered communities (Vicus Pirustarum) and were under the jurisdiction of their own tribal leadership (with individual leaders referred to as princeps).	這些達爾馬提亞礦工被看守在庇護社區 (維庫斯皮魯斯塔魯姆) 並由他們自己的部落領導管轄 (個別領導者稱為第一公民)。
An estimated 50,000 troops were stationed in Dacia at its height.	在巔峰時期，估計有 50,000 支部隊駐紮在達契亞。
At the close of Trajan's first campaign in Dacia in 102, he stationed one legion at Sarmizegetusa Regia.	102 年，圖拉真在達契亞的第一場戰役結束時，將一支軍團駐紮在薩爾米澤傑圖薩雷吉亞。
With the conclusion of Trajan's conquest of Dacia, he stationed at least two legions in the new province – the Legio IV Flavia Felix positioned at Berzobis, and the Legio XIII Gemina stationed at Apulum.	圖拉真對達契亞的征戰結束後，在新的省駐紮了至少兩支軍團──幸運者弗拉維烏斯第四軍團駐紮在貝爾索比斯，而第十三雙子軍團駐紮在阿普魯姆。
It has been conjectured that there was a third legion stationed in Dacia at the same time, the Legio I Adiutrix.	據推測，同時還有第三支軍團駐紮在達契亞，也就是第一輔助軍團。
However, there is no evidence to indicate when or where it was stationed, and it is unclear whether the legion was fully present, or whether it was only the vexillationes who were stationed in the province.	但是沒有證據顯示它在何時或何處駐紮，因此無法確定該軍團是否充分存在，或者它是否僅為駐紮在該省的支隊。
Hadrian, the subsequent emperor, shifted the fourth legion (Legio IV Flavia Felix) from Berzobis to Singidunum in Moesia Superior, suggesting that Hadrian believed the presence of one legion in Dacia would be sufficient to ensure the security of the province.	繼任的皇帝哈德良將第四軍團 (幸運者弗拉維烏斯第四軍團) 從貝爾索比斯調到上默西亞的辛吉杜努姆，這顯示哈德良認為達契亞有一個軍團就足以確保該省的安全。
The Marcomannic Wars that erupted north of the Danube forced Marcus Aurelius to reverse this policy, permanently transferring the Legio V Macedonica from Troesmis (modern Iglița in Romania) in Moesia Inferior to Potaissa in Dacia.	在多瑙河北部爆發的馬科曼尼戰爭迫使馬可·奧理略逆轉了此政策；他將第五馬其頓軍團從下默西亞的特洛埃斯米斯 (現今在羅馬尼亞的伊斯特拉) 永久調動至達契亞的波塔薩。
The Kingston Fossil Plant is located on a peninsula at the junction of the Emory River (to the north) and Clinch River (to the south and east), just over 4 miles (6.4 km) upstream from the latter's mouth along the Tennessee River.	金斯頓化石燃料發電廠位於埃默里河 (以北) 和克林奇河 (以南和以東) 匯合處的半島上，就在後者的河口上游 4 英哩 (6.4 公里) 處田納西河岸上。
Watts Bar Dam, located along the Tennessee 38 miles (61 km) downstream from the mouth of the Clinch, impounds a reservoir (Watts Bar Lake) that spans a 72-mile (116 km) stretch of the Tennessee (to Fort Loudoun Dam), the lower 23 miles (37 km) of the Clinch (to Melton Hill Dam), and the lower 12 miles (19 km) of the Emory.	瓦茲巴爾水壩位於克林奇河河口下游 38 英哩 (61 公里) 的田納西河沿岸，所圍起的貯水區 (瓦茲巴爾湖) 橫跨田納西河 (往勞登堡水壩) 72 英哩 (116 公里) 河段、克林奇河 (往梅爾頓丘水壩) 下方 23 英哩 (37 公里)，以及埃默里河下方 12 英哩 (19 公里)。
The plant, originally known as the Kingston Steam Plant, began operations in 1954, primarily to provide electricity to atomic energy installations at nearby Oak Ridge.	這間發電廠原本稱為金斯頓蒸氣發電廠，在 1954 年開始營運，主要為附近橡樹嶺的核子動力設備提供電力。
The plant contains nine units with a combined generating capacity of 1,398 megawatts, and burns about 14,000 tonnes (14,000,000 kg) of coal every day.	發電廠包含九個機組，總發電量 1,398 百萬瓦特，且每天燃燒約 14,000 公噸 (14,000,000 公斤) 的煤。
The plant's ash pond disposal area is located immediately north of the plant along the Emory River shore.	發電廠的灰塘處置區就位在發電廠北邊的埃默里河河岸上。
The ash pond, which was impounded by a dike that rose 60 feet (18 m) above the winter level and 741 feet (226 m) above sea level, contained a watery slurry of fly ash generated by the burning of finely ground coal at the power plant.	灰塘以冬季水位以上 60 英呎 (18 公尺)、海平面以上 741 英呎 (226 公尺) 的堤防圍起，含有發電廠燃燒精細研磨的煤所產生的飛灰泥漿。
Fly ash is the fine particulate pollutants produced by the combustion of coal, which are collected rather than allowing them to escape into the atmosphere, then mixed with water and pumped into a retaining pond, where the ash gradually settles to the bottom.	飛灰是燃煤所產生的精細粒狀汙染物，不能讓它逸出到大氣中，而是必須收集起來，然後與水混合並灌注到滯留池中，讓灰燼在池內逐漸沉澱到底部。
Once the particulate matter settles out, it is dredged and moved to drying cells.	一旦粒狀物沉澱出來，就會將它挖出並移至乾燥槽。
The 84-acre (0.34 km²) unlined above-ground dredge cell was surrounded by 60-foot (18 m) tall earthen dikes.	這個 84 英畝 (0.34 平方公里) 無襯砌的地上疏濬槽是用 60 英呎 (18 公尺) 高的土製堤防圍住。
The dike breach occurred at the northwest corner of the dewatering pond, overlooking the Swan Pond Creek spillway.	堤壩決口發生在脫水槽的西北角，就在天鵝池溪溢洪道的上方。
TVA had reportedly known about the dangers of using wet storage ponds for coal ash since a 1969 spill in Virginia in which coal ash seeped into the Clinch River and killed countless fish.	據報導，TVA 自 1969 年維吉尼亞州外洩事件後就瞭解到使用濕式煤灰儲存槽的危險性；當時在維吉尼亞州，煤灰滲進克林奇河並殺死了無數的魚隻。
In the 1980s, TVA engineers raised concerns about the stability of ash ponds.	1980 年代，TVA 工程師曾提出有關灰塘穩定性的疑慮。
The utility repeatedly found leaks in levees and seepage in the soil at many of their ash ponds, including the ones at Kingston.	這間公用事業公司屢次在其多個灰塘發現堤防裂縫和土壤滲流，包括在金斯頓的灰塘。
However, TVA continued to make small repairs instead of switch to dry storage systems which would have cost ratepayers tens of millions.	但是，TVA 仍繼續進行小型維修，而不是改用可能會花費地方納稅人數千萬元的乾式儲存系統。
At the time of the disaster, TVA was using wet storage at six of their 11 coal-fired power plants.	發生災害的當下，TVA 正在其 11 座燃煤發電廠中的六座使用濕式儲存。
Leaks at the Kingston ash ponds had reportedly been taking place since the early 1980s, and local residents said that the spill was not a unique occurrence.	據報導，金斯頓灰塘的裂縫從 1980 年代初期就一直在發生，當地居民也表示滲漏並非單一事件。
The 1960s-era pond had been observed leaking and being repaired nearly every year since 2001.	自 2001 年起，幾乎每年都有人發現這座 1960 年代的池塘發生滲漏和進行維修。
The two worst leaks occurred in 2003 and 2006 in which TVA suspended all ash deposits in the ponds to allow the dredge cells to dry out and stabilize.	兩次最嚴重的滲漏發生在 2003 年和 2006 年，當時 TVA 暫停池塘中的所有灰渣沉積，以便疏濬槽乾燥並穩定下來。
An October 2008 inspection report had identified a "minor leak" in the faulty wall, but the report was not finalized.	2008 年 10 月的一項檢查報告在問題牆面發現一個「小型滲漏」，但該報告並未獲得最終確認。
The spill began sometime between midnight and 1 a.m.	滲漏是在午夜到上午 1 點之間的某個時候開始。
In January 1973 Young was made Chief of the Space Shuttle Branch of the Astronaut Office.	1973 年 1 月，楊恩獲任太空人辦公室太空梭分部主任。
In January 1974, he became Chief of the Astronaut Office after the retirement of Alan Shepard.	1974 年 1 月，他在艾倫·雪帕德退休之後成為太空人辦公室主任。
Young flew two missions of the Space Shuttle, both aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia.	楊恩飛行過兩個太空梭任務，兩者都是在哥倫比亞號太空梭上。
He commanded the program's 1981 maiden orbital flight, STS-1, and in 1983 commanded STS-9, which carried the first Spacelab module.	他曾指揮該計畫的 1981 年初次軌道飛行 (STS-1)，並在 1983 年指揮 STS-9，運送了第一間太空實驗室模組。
In 1986 he was in line to make a record seventh space flight on STS-61-J to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, but the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster earlier that year had delayed NASA's schedule.	1986 年，他有相當大的機會能夠在 STS-61-J 創下第七次太空飛行以部署哈伯太空望遠鏡的紀錄，但是該年年初的挑戰者號太空梭災難延誤了 NASA 的行程。
Young was openly critical of NASA management following the Challenger disaster, and in April 1987 was made Special Assistant to JSC Director Aaron Cohen for Engineering, Operations and Safety.	楊恩在挑戰者災難之後公開批評 NASA 的管理部門，並在 1987 年 4 月獲任 JSC 主任亞倫·科恩在工程、營運及安全的特別助理。
NASA denied that his criticism triggered the move, although Young and industry insiders believed that was the reason for the reassignment.	NASA 否認他的批評引發此舉，雖然楊恩和業界內部人士認為那就是重新派任的原因。
In February 1996, he was assigned as Associate Director (Technical) JSC.	1996 年 2 月，他獲指派為 JSC 副主任 (技術)。
During his NASA career, Young logged more than 15,000 hours of training, mostly in simulators, to prepare for positions on eleven spaceflights in prime and backup crew positions.	在楊恩的 NASA 職業生涯期間，他記錄了超過 15,000 小時的訓練，大部分是在模擬機內，目的是為十一場太空飛行的首選和後備職位做好準備。
Young worked for NASA for 42 years and announced his retirement on December 7, 2004.	楊恩在 NASA 工作了 42 年，並在 2004 年 12 月 7 日宣布退休。
He retired on December 31, 2004, at the age of 74, but continued to attend the Monday Morning Meeting at the Astronaut Office at JSC for several years thereafter.	他在 2004 年 12 月 31 日時退休，當時 74 歲，但之後數年仍繼續參加 JSC 太空人辦公室的週一晨會。
He logged more than 15,275 hours flying time in props, jets, helicopters, and rocket jets; more than 9,200 hours in T-38s; and 835 hours in spacecraft during six space flights.	他在輔具、噴射機、直升機和火箭噴射器記錄了超過 15,275 小時的飛行時間；在 T-38 有超過 9,200 小時；而在六次太空飛行期間的太空船內有 835 小時。
On April 12, 2006, Young appeared at the 25th anniversary of the STS-1 launch at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, along with pilot Robert Crippen.	2006 年 4 月 12 日，楊恩在甘迺迪太空中心參觀園區的 STS-1 發射 25 週年紀念與駕駛員羅伯特·克里彭一起現身。
The two spoke of their experiences during the flight.	他們兩位都談到飛行期間的體驗。
In 2012, Young published an autobiography, Forever Young.	2012 年，楊恩出版了自傳《永遠的楊恩》。
Young married Barbara White of Savannah, Georgia, and they had two children, Sandra and John.	楊恩與來自喬治亞州薩凡納的芭芭拉·懷特結婚，育有兩名子女，珊卓拉和約翰。
They were divorced in 1972 after 16 years of marriage.	他們在結婚 16 年之後於 1972 年離婚。
He later married Susy Feldman, and lived in El Lago, Texas, a suburb of Houston.	他之後與蘇西·費爾德曼結婚，並居住在德州休士頓的郊區艾爾拉哥
Young died on January 5, 2018, at his home in Houston of complications from pneumonia.	楊恩於 2018 年 1 月 5 日因肺炎併發症逝世於他在休士頓的家中。
He was 87.	享年 87 歲。
Abbotsford Bridge is a steel Allan truss bridge that is about 240 m (790 ft) in length.	艾柏茲弗德橋是鋼製艾倫式桁架橋，長度約 240 公尺 (790 英呎)。
The bridge also contains a single lift span about 20 m (66 ft) in length, which is still in working order.	這座橋也含有長度約 20 公尺 (66 英呎) 的單一升降節間，而且至今仍正常運作。
It is two lanes wide through most of its length, but the lift span is only capable of carrying a single lane.	它的全長大部分為兩車道寬，但是升降節間只能載運單一車道。
The entire bridge has been marked with a single lane and has traffic lights on both ends to control vehicular flow.	整座橋都標示為單一車道，而且兩端都有交通號誌來控制車流。
The bridge was completed in 1928 by the NSW Department of Public Works and, although opened as a traffic bridge, it was designed to carry the loads required for a railway, once the Mildura railway line had been extended over the bridge.	這座橋由 NSW 公共工程部門在 1928 年完工，而且雖然開放作為交通橋，它原本的設計是在米爾杜拉鐵路線延伸至橋上之後，作為鐵路所需的負重乘載。
The line was never extended beyond Yelta, where the terminus remains to this day.	該路線從未延伸超過耶爾塔，也就是至今的終點站。
The location of the bridge was thought to be convenient, as it provided a link to the Sturt Highway without travelling farther upstream to Mildura.	這座橋的地點被認為相當便利，因為它提供與斯圖特公路的連結，不需向上行經更遠到米爾杜拉。
It is the only remaining steel truss bridge with a lift span on the Murray, although other lifting bridges still exist along the river.	雖然墨瑞河沿岸仍有其他升降橋，但它是河上唯一僅存具備升降節間的桁架橋。
The bridge was built after the decline in commercial river traffic on the Murray.	這座橋是在墨瑞河的商運河運量下降之後建造的。
Due to its significance to the local area, it has been listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.	因為它對當地區域具有重要性，已名列在 NSW 州遺產登記上。
The nearby town of Wentworth was an important river port from which wool was shipped to the coast, and as such there was a variety of traffic in the area.	附近的溫特沃斯市鎮是重要的河港，羊毛是從該河港運送到海岸，也因此該區域有許多種類的交通。
In the 1890s, irrigated farming greatly expanded in Sunraysia region which is known for its fruit production, and traffic volumes increased further.	在 1890 年代，灌溉農作在以其水果生產聞名的桑瑞西亞地區大幅擴展，交通量也進一步提高。
It was decided to install a punt at this location (then known as Abbot's Ford).	人們決定在此地點 (之後稱為艾伯茲弗德) 安裝平底船。
New South Wales and Victoria had signed an agreement towards constructing bridges for railways over the Murray to serve the settlements on the northern side.	新南威爾斯和維多利亞簽署了一項協議，為墨瑞河上的鐵路建造橋墩以服務北邊的聚落。
In 1923, a report was released that recommended going ahead with the building of four bridges, one of those being the future Abbotsford Bridge.	1923 年發表了一項報告建議繼續建造四座橋，其中一座就是日後的亞伯茲弗德橋。
It was said a bridge in this area would benefit Curlwaa, Wentworth, and a proposed irrigation scheme to the north.	據說此區域的橋會使庫爾瓦、溫特沃斯和北邊規劃的灌溉方案受益。
The cost was estimated at £78,000.	成本估計為 78,000 英鎊。
It had been considered that it might be appropriate to combine these four bridges with locks, but this idea was rejected due to siting concerns.	有人認為以水閘將這四座橋結合在一起可能是適當的，但是此構想因為選址問題而遭到否決。
In 1924, residents of nearby settlements urged construction of the railway line to the proposed bridge site, but they were told this extension of the line was to be delayed.	1924 年，附近聚落的居民極力主張建造通往提案橋址的鐵路線，但是被告知此路線的延伸有所延誤。
Within that year it was decided that a bridge was to be constructed due to increased traffic volume, and tenders were let for manufacture of the bridge spans, construction of abutments and piles, and transport of materials to the future construction site.	在那一年內，因為交通量的增加而決定建造一座橋，並針對橋跨的製造、橋座和樁的建造，以及對日後建造地點的物料運送等發包投標。
Achebe expanded this criticism when he presented a Chancellor's Lecture at Amherst on 18 February 1975, 'An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's "Heart of Darkness"'.	阿切貝在 1975 年 2 月 18 日於阿姆赫斯特進行「非洲印象：康拉德《黑暗之心》中的種族歧視」校長座談時詳述了這個評論。
Decrying Joseph Conrad as "a bloody racist", Achebe asserted that Conrad's famous novel dehumanises Africans, rendering Africa as "a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognisable humanity, into which the wandering European enters at his peril."	阿切貝譴責約瑟夫·康拉德是「該死的種族主義者」，且聲稱康拉德的知名小說使非洲人失去人性，將非洲描繪成「全然沒有任何可辨識之人性的抽象戰場」，而四處遊蕩的歐洲人自冒風險進入其中。
Achebe also discussed a quotation from Albert Schweitzer, a 1952 Nobel Peace Prize laureate: "That extraordinary missionary, Albert Schweitzer, who sacrificed brilliant careers in music and theology in Europe for a life of service to Africans in much the same area as Conrad writes about, epitomizes the ambivalence.	阿切貝也討論了來自 1952 年諾貝爾和平獎得主阿爾伯特·史懷哲的一段引言：「那位非凡的傳教士阿爾伯特·史懷哲，犧牲了在歐洲的音樂和神學等出色的事業，在幾乎與康拉德所寫的相同地區為非洲人奉獻一生，正體現了這種矛盾心態。
In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: 'The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother.' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being." Some were surprised that Achebe would challenge a man honoured in the West for his "reverence for life".	史懷哲在一段經常被引用的評論中說：『非洲人確實是我的兄弟，不過是我的學弟。』於是他運用疾病的細菌理論誕生前之醫療作法的懷舊衛生標準，開始建造適合學弟需求的醫院。」對於阿切貝挑戰一位因為「敬畏生命」在西方國家備受崇敬的男人，有些人感到相當驚訝。
The lecture caused a storm of controversy, even at the reception immediately following his talk.	這段演說引發激烈的爭議，甚至在他談話之後的接待會也是。
Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks; one elderly professor reportedly approached him, said: "How dare you!", and stormed away.	許多出席的英國教授對他的註解感到不滿；據報導，一位年長的教授走近他說：「你好大的膽子！」，然後怒氣沖沖地離開。
Another suggested that Achebe had "no sense of humour", but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor, who told him: "I now realize that I had never really read Heart of Darkness although I have taught it for years." Although the lecture angered many of his colleagues, he was nevertheless presented later in 1975 with an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling and the Lotus Prize for Afro-Asian Writers.	另一人指稱阿切貝「沒有幽默感」，但是幾天後第三位教授聯繫阿切貝，並告訴他：「我現在才發現我從未真正讀過《黑暗之心》，雖然我已經教了好多年。」雖然這場演說激怒了多位同仁，他之後仍在 1975 年獲頒斯特靈大學的榮譽博士以及亞非作家的荷花文學獎。
The first comprehensive rebuttal of Achebe's critique was published in 1983 by British critic Cedric Watts.	針對阿切貝的評論所提出的首次全面反駁在 1983 年由英國評論家塞德里克·沃茨發表。
His essay "A Bloody Racist: About Achebe's View of Conrad" defends Heart of Darkness as an anti-imperialist novel, suggesting that "part of its greatness lies in the power of its criticisms of racial prejudice." Palestinian–American theorist Edward Said agreed in his book Culture and Imperialism that Conrad criticised imperialism, but added: "As a creature of his time, Conrad could not grant the natives their freedom, despite his severe critique of the imperialism that enslaved them".	他的論文《該死的種族主義者：關於阿切貝對康拉德的觀點》以反帝國主義小說來捍衛《黑暗之心》，指出「其部分偉大之處在於它對種族偏見批評的力量。」巴勒斯坦裔美籍理論家愛德華·薩依德在他的《文化與帝國主義》一書中同意康拉德對帝國主義有所批評，但是補充說：「身為他所在時代的產物，儘管康拉德對奴役原住民的帝國主義有所嚴厲批評，也無法賦予他們自由」。
Building on Watts and Said, Nidesh Lawtoo argued that "underneath the first layer of straightforward opposition ... we find an underlying mimetic continuity between Conrad's colonial image of Africa [in Heart of Darkness] and Achebe's postcolonial representation" in Things Fall Apart.	繼沃茨和薩伊德之後，尼德許·勞圖主張，在《生命中不可承受之重》當中，「在第一層直接了當的反對意見之下……我們發現康拉德 [在《黑暗之心》中] 的非洲殖民印象與阿切貝的後殖民表述之間，有隱含在其中的模仿連貫性。
Achebe's criticism has become a mainstream perspective on Conrad's work.	阿切貝的批評已成為對於康拉德作品的主流觀點。
The essay was included in the 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel.	這篇論文被收入 1988 年康拉德小說的諾頓評論版中。
Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book ..." Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books.	主筆羅伯·金布羅將它稱為「自他的書籍第二版之後在《黑暗之心》評論方面最重要的三個事件之一……」評論家尼古拉斯·特雷德爾將康拉德評論劃分成「兩個劃時代階段：阿切貝之前和之後。」因為經常被問及有關他的論文，阿切貝曾經說明他從未意圖讓該作品遭到棄用：「我的本質並非討論禁止書籍。
I am saying, read it – with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about.	我的意思是，好好閱讀它──運用理解的本質和我提到的知識。
And read it beside African works." Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": "Conrad was a seductive writer.	並且以與非洲作品相比的方式來閱讀。」在全國公共廣播電台與羅伯特·西格爾訪談後，在 2009 年 10 月，阿切貝仍堅持己見，但是在一場名為「《黑暗之心》並不得當」的討論中將淡化了批評：「康拉德是引人注意的作家。
He could pull his reader into the fray.	他能夠將讀者引進紛爭。
And if it were not for what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction."	而且如果不是因為他對我和我的人民所做的評論，我可能只會想到那種誘因。」
When he returned to the University of Nigeria in 1976, he hoped to accomplish three goals: finish the novel he had been writing, renew the native publication of Okike, and further his study of Igbo culture.	1976 年返回奈及利亞大學時，他希望達成三個目標：完成他正在寫的小說、重做《奧基凱》的原生版，以及繼續深造他對伊博文化的研究。
He also showed that he would not restrict his criticism to European targets.	他也表明，他不會只將批評限制在歐洲的目標上。
In an August 1976 interview, he lashed out at the archetypal Nigerian intellectual, who is divorced from the intellect "but for two things: status and stomach.	在 1976 年 8 月的一場訪談中，他大力批評與知識界脫鉤的原型奈及利亞知識分子「不就是為了兩件事：地位和肚子。
On August 3, 2011, contestants Ricky Jaime and Sasha Mallory danced to "Schoolin Life" in Top 6 Perform round of the eighth season of the American television reality program and dance competition So You Think You Can Dance.	2011 年 8 月 3 日，參賽者瑞奇·傑米和薩夏·馬洛里在美國電視實境節目和舞蹈競賽《舞林爭霸》第八季的前 6 強表演回合中跳了《學校生活》。
Their dance performance was choreographed by Kumari Suraj.	他們的舞蹈表演是由庫馬里·蘇拉杰所編排。
Gwen Orel of The Wall Street Journal further described their performance during a review of that episode of the show: "He's in a fedora, and she's got a cute short swingy sheer skirt, with thigh high stockings and a garter belt, and a sheer purple blouse.	華爾街日報的葛溫·奧瑞爾在節目的該集評論中進一步形容了他們的表演：「他戴著紳士帽，她則是穿著一件可愛的搖擺透明短裙，搭配高度到大腿的長筒襪及吊襪帶，以及透明的紫色短上衣。
I don’t get what this style really is, it seems to have a lot of arm movements, and some crouching jumps.	我不懂這個風格到底是什麼，它似乎有大量的手臂動作和一些蹲跳。
He doesn’t look quite sharp enough next to her.	他在她旁邊看起來不夠顯眼。
His split leap is phenomenal."	他的分腿跳非常傑出。」
The base slab, or pylon, of the tomb monument rests on a 38-centimetre (15 in) high plinth, separated by a cornice and concave mouldings.	紀念墓的底板 (或稱為塔門) 坐落在 38 公分 (15 英吋) 的高基座上，由飛簷和凹面飾材分隔。
The pylon is 1.39 metres (4.56 ft) high and 2.02 metres (6.63 ft) wide, decorated with a frieze of winged angel heads (perhaps seraphim) and garlands and ribbons.	門塔為 1.39 公尺 (4.56 英呎) 高和 2.02 公尺 (6.63 英呎) 寬，以帶翅膀的天使頭部 (可能是熾天使) 飾帶、花環和緞帶裝飾。
Above the pylon, separated by the cornice, are the three Virtues—from left to right, Faith, Charity, and Hope—in shell niches, separated by four Corinthian fluted pilasters.	在門塔上方，由飛簷所分隔的是貝殼壁龕內的三個德天使，由左至右為「信」、「望」和「愛」，以科林斯柱式波形壁柱區隔。
Such a motif is unprecedented in Tuscan funerary sculpture but found at this date in Venice, Padua, and especially Cossa's native Naples.	這種裝飾圖案在托斯坎喪葬雕塑中前所未見，但當時在威尼斯、帕多瓦以及特別是科薩的出生地拿坡里都有發現。
As a result, excursions to Venice have been suggested for both Michelozzo and Donatello.	因此，米開羅佐和多那太羅兩人獲建議到威尼斯進行短程旅行。
However, Janson suggests that one "need not go all the way to Venice" to find such motifs.	但是，簡森建議「不需要大老遠前往威尼斯」尋找這類裝飾圖案。
Outside Florence, Virtues were common on tombs, with the cardinal Virtues used for laymen, and the theological virtues reserved for ecclesiastics, including the Brancaccio tomb.	在佛羅倫斯之外，德天使在墳墓上相當常見 (平信徒使用樞德)，三超德則是保留為傳教士使用，包括布蘭卡奇樞機墓。
However, the Cossa Virtues, from their hair to their sandals, are more thoroughly antique.	但是，科薩德天使從頭髮到涼鞋是更徹底的古希臘和古羅馬風格。
Donatello also produced two similar bronze Virtues for the Siena Baptistry, whose chronological relationship to the Cossa Virtues is unclear.	多那太羅也為錫耶納洗禮堂製作了兩座類似的銅製德天使，它們與科薩德天使的時序關係不得而知。
The 1.05-metre (3.44 ft) tall Faith, to the right of Charity, is holding a Eucharistic chalice; the 1.07-metre (3.51 ft) tall Charity is holding a cornucopia and a brazier (or flaming vase); and the 1.06-metre (3.48 ft) tall Hope, to the left of Charity, has hands clasped in prayer.	在「愛」右邊 1.05 公尺 (3.44 英呎) 高的「信」拿著聖體聖杯；1.07 公尺 (3.51 英呎) 高的「愛」拿著豐裕之角和火盆 (或火瓶)；而在「愛」左邊 1.06 公尺 (3.48 英呎) 高的「望」則是雙手合十。
The central figure of Charity is the most antique, assimilating elements of Classical depictions of Abundantia, Ceres, and Juno, all of which were depicted with cornucopias in their left hands.	中間的人物「愛」最具古希臘和古羅馬藝術風格，吸收了阿布恩丹提亞、瑟雷斯和朱諾的經典描繪元素，而且上述所有的描繪都是左手拿著豐裕之角。
Besides underscoring the antiquity of the tomb monument, the main purpose of the tall yet poorly finished Virtues is to put additional vertical distance between the viewer and the effigy, which has the cumulative effect of de-emphasizing the peculiarities of Cossa, in favor of a generic pontiff (i.e. a potential line of Florentine popes), by blunting the "immediacy" of the trope of lying in state, which was otherwise dominant on Quattrocento wall tombs.	除了強調紀念墓的古希臘和古羅馬藝術風格以外，這座高聳但潤飾不足的德天使，主要是為了在觀賞者和雕像之間增添額外的垂直距離，透過減弱死者平躺狀態象徵的「既視感」(這在文藝復興壁墓中是主流)，對於淡化科薩的奇特性、對總主教的支持 (亦即潛在的佛羅倫斯教宗路線) 有加成效果。
On top of the sarcophagus, the bier of the effigy is supported by lions whose shape mimics Trecento consoles.	在石棺上方，雕像的棺架是由外型模仿十四世紀螺形支架的獅子所支撐。
The lions may be based on the Florentine Marzocco, as if to mark John XXIII in the same manner as a conquered city-state.	這些獅子可能是以佛羅倫斯紋章獅子為基準樣式，彷彿以相同方式將若望二十三世標記為征服的城邦。
As Donatello's Marzocco for the papal apartment in Santa Maria Novella conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim.	由於對聖塔瑪莉亞諾維拉的教皇公寓而言，多那太羅的紋章獅子傳達出佛羅倫斯對瑪爾定五世的矛盾心態 (因為兩者都是派駐的聲望來源，也是共和國的潛在敵手)，支撐棺架的獅子透過鞏固佛羅倫斯主張的方式，將紀念墓支持若望二十三世教皇地位的主張化為情境。
Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be taken with a grain of salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous, and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d. 1342) in the Bargello.	但是，任何對獅子的圖像誌解譯都不得盡信，因為獅子有雜交的象徵，也在早期的墳墓中被視為支撐物，例如巴傑羅美術館中拉波·德·巴爾迪 (1342 年逝世) 的墳墓。
The bier and the pall spread over it are tilted towards the viewer with the lion supporting the head standing 2-centimetre (1 in) shorter, increasing the visibility of the effigy, especially the head.	棺架和攤開在其上的墓布向觀賞者的方向傾斜，且支撐頭部的獅子高度短了 2 公分 (1 英吋)，使得雕像更為顯眼，尤其是頭部。
The gilded-bronze, life-size effigy itself makes no attempt to argue for Cossa's papal status, dressing Cossa clearly in the costume of a cardinal; the bedding it rests on is of un-gilt bronze.	本身是擬金青銅且真人大小的雕像明確地穿上樞機主教的服裝，顯然主張著科薩的教皇地位；它所長眠的床墊是以非擬金青銅製成。
The opening in the 16th century of the sarcophagus confirmed that Cossa's actual burial clothes matched the effigy.	16 世紀時，石棺的開啟確認了科薩實際的壽衣與雕像相符。
There was no precedent for a three-dimensional gilded-bronze effigy on an Italian tomb monument; there was, however, a 6-foot (1.83 m) gilt bronze statue on the balcony of the Palazzo della Briada in Bologna commissioned by Pope Boniface VIII.	義大利紀念墓上先前未出現過立體的鍍銅雕像；不過，有一個由教宗波尼法爵八世委託在波隆那的比亞達宮露臺製作的 6 英呎 (1.83 公尺) 鍍金銅製雕像。
Chief Wiggum pulls Troy McClure over for dangerous driving.	維古姆警官以危險駕駛為由請特洛伊·麥克盧爾停靠到路邊。
Not wishing to be required to wear his glasses while driving, Troy goes to the DMV to get his license changed to remove the requirement.	因為不希望開車時必須戴著眼鏡，特洛伊前往監理所更換駕照以刪除此要求。
He offers to take DMV employee Selma Bouvier to dinner if she lets him pass the eye test, to which she agrees.	他提議，如果監理所員工塞爾瑪·布維爾讓他通過視力檢測，就請她吃晚餐，而她同意了。
After dinner, photographers notice Troy leaving with Selma and the story hits the news.	晚餐後，攝影師們注意到特洛伊與塞爾瑪一起離開，而該報導也躍上新聞版面。
The next day, Troy's agent, MacArthur Parker, calls and says that he can get work again if he continues seeing Selma.	隔天，特洛伊的經紀人麥克阿瑟·帕克來電表示，如果他繼續和塞爾瑪見面，就可以再次獲得工作。
Troy continues to date her and his career begins to recover.	特洛伊繼續和她約會，他的事業也開始恢復原狀。
On his agent's advice, Troy asks Selma to marry him; she agrees.	在經紀人的建議下，特洛伊向塞爾瑪求婚；她同意了。
The night before the wedding, a drunk Troy tells Homer the reason for his marriage: he doesn't really love Selma, and he just plans to use her as a sham wife to help further his career.	婚禮的前一晚，喝醉酒的特洛伊對荷馬訴說他結婚的原因：他並非真的愛塞爾瑪，他只是打算利用她虛假的妻子身分讓事業更上一層樓。
Although Homer fails to act, Marge and Patty try to explain it to Selma, who accuses them of just being envious.	雖然荷馬並未採取行動，不過美枝和帕蒂試著向塞爾瑪解釋，而塞爾瑪指責她們只是嫉妒。
She confronts Troy, who shamelessly admits that their marriage is a sham but explains she has everything she could want and will be "the envy of every other sham wife in town".	她向特洛伊對質，他厚著臉皮承認他們的婚姻是個幌子，但是解釋說，她什麼都能夠如願以償，而且將成為「鎮上所有其他虛假妻子忌妒的對象」。
Selma has doubts, but accepts the situation because she fears being alone.	塞爾瑪有所懷疑，但是因為害怕獨處而接受了這個情況。
Parker thinks he can get Troy the part of McBain's sidekick in McBain IV: Fatal Discharge, but concludes he will have a better chance if he has a family.	帕克認為他可以讓特洛伊在《麥克貝恩 4：致命排放》中擔任麥克貝恩的搭檔，但是斷定如果他成家會更有機會。
Troy and Selma try to conceive a child, but neither feels comfortable with their situation, and Selma finally leaves after deciding that bringing a child into a loveless family is wrong.	特洛伊和塞爾瑪試著懷孕，但是兩者都對所處的情況感到不自在，而塞爾瑪在決定讓孩子進到沒有愛的家是錯誤的之後，最後還是離開了。
During the first half of the end credits, news confirmed that Troy turns down the role of McBain's sidekick to direct and star in his own film, The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.	在片尾字幕的前半段，有新聞確認了特洛伊拒絕麥克貝恩搭檔的角色，在自己的電影《何瑞修·赫夫納格教授的超棒發明》中自導自演。
Show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were fans of actor Phil Hartman, who had been a recurring guest star since the second season.	節目統籌比爾·奧克利和喬許·威恩斯坦是演員菲爾·哈特曼的粉絲；菲爾·哈特曼曾在第二季之後固定客串。
They decided to produce an episode entirely about his character Troy McClure to give Hartman as much to do as possible.	他們決定製作一段完全圍繞在其角色特洛伊·麥克盧爾的影集，讓哈特曼盡情發揮。
Oakley wanted to explore Troy's character because he had never interacted with the show's other characters before, only appearing on television.	奧克利想要探索特洛伊的角色，因為他之前從未與這個節目的其他角色互動過，只在電視上出現。
The writers chose the plot idea of Troy's marriage to Selma Bouvier because she was "always marrying people".	編劇選擇了特洛伊與塞爾瑪·布維爾的婚姻情節構想，因為她「一直和人結婚」。
The episode's first draft was written by freelance writer Jack Barth, although the rest of the writing staff rewrote it.	這一集的第一部草稿是由自由作家傑克·巴爾思編寫，但其他編劇工作人員將它改寫了。
One aspect of the rewrite was the song "Dr. Zaius" from the Planet of the Apes musical, which the staff consider to be one of the greatest musical numbers ever written for The Simpsons.	改寫的其中一個層面是來自《浩劫餘生》音樂劇的歌曲「佐斯博士」，工作人員認為這首歌是為《辛普森家庭》所寫最棒的演奏歌曲之一。
Clair was created for The Cosby Show by series creator, comedian Bill Cosby.	克萊兒是影集創作者 (喜劇影星比爾·寇司比) 為《天才老爹》所創造出來。
Cosby originally pitched a series about a detective who solves crime using his wit and humor; Clair's earliest incarnation resembled his character's girlfriend, who is depicted as "a strong woman with her own career." Networks were not interested in developing the series, so Cosby opted for a somewhat more autobiographical approach instead.	寇司比原本的提案是有關一位警探運用機智和幽默解決刑案的系列影集；克萊兒的早期化身與該角色的女朋友相似，她被描寫成「擁有自己事業的女強人」。電視網對開發此影集沒有興趣，因此寇司比改為選擇較為自傳式的方法。
Cosby eventually based The Cosby Show on his stand-up comedy film Bill Cosby: Himself (1983), which heavily features jokes about his relationship with his wife and their interactions with their children.	寇司比最後根據他的單口喜劇電影《比爾·寇司比：他本人》(1983) 改編成《天才老爹》，該電影大量採用有關他與妻子的關係以及他們與孩子的互動等笑話。
Clair is based on Cosby's real-life wife Camille.	克萊兒是根據寇司比現實生活的妻子卡蜜兒所改編。
Although the role of the parents in the show evolved dramatically from The Cosby Show's initial inception to final production, the one idea that was retained from Cosby's detective series was the concept of a strong career woman.	雖然節目中的雙親角色從《天才老爹》最初到最終製作有大幅的改變，但是從寇司比警探系列影集中保留的唯一構想是女強人的概念。
When Cosby originally pitched The Cosby Show to NBC, it revolved around the life of a blue-collar couple; Clair was intended to be a plumber while the character's husband Cliff, portrayed by Cosby himself, was a limousine driver.	寇司比原本向 NBC 提案《天才老爹》時，是以一對藍領夫妻的生活為主題；克萊兒原本是水管工，該角色的丈夫克里夫 (由寇司比本人所飾演) 則是禮車司機。
Eventually, the idea of Clair working as a plumber was discarded and the character briefly became a Dominican housewife instead.	最後，克萊兒是水管工的構想遭到捨棄，且該角色短暫地換成多明尼加籍家庭主婦。
Inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I Love Lucy, of whom Cosby was a fan, much of the show's humor would have been directly derived from Clair's tendency to revert to her native language Spanish when upset or agitated.	寇司比受到情境喜劇《我愛露西》中的瑞奇·里卡多激發靈感 (他是該劇的粉絲)，因此該影集的大多數幽默感是直接來自克萊兒生氣或焦慮時變回母語西班牙文的傾向。
Describing this concept as "the reverse of [I Love] Lucy," Cosby explained that the husband "would be the person that didn’t understand when she spoke Spanish" as opposed to the wife.	寇司比將這個概念形容成「[我愛] 露西的相反」，他解釋，這位丈夫「會是聽不懂西班牙文的人」，而不是妻子。
Camille and executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner eventually convinced Cosby that the series should feature a family that resembled their own more closely, specifically one headed by a pair of successful parents with white-collar professions.	卡蜜兒和執行製作人馬西·卡斯及湯姆·沃納最終說服寇司比，該影集的特色應該是與他們自己更相似的家庭；具體而言，就是由一對擁有白領職業的成功雙親所帶領的家庭。
Thus, Cosby relented and re-wrote Clair and Cliff into a lawyer and doctor, respectively.	因此，寇司比態度軟化，並將克萊兒與克里夫分別改寫成律師及醫師。
The idea of Clair being Dominican was abandoned before the pilot was filmed.	克萊兒是多明尼加人的構想在錄製試播集之前遭到捨棄。
However, the character still speaks some Spanish in the first episode and continues to speak the language periodically throughout the series, albeit not as frequently as Cosby had originally intended.	但是，該角色在第一集仍然會說一點西班牙語，且在整個系列影集中仍然會不時說該語言，雖然不像寇司比一原本想要的那樣頻繁。
Cosby borrowed several names from his real-life family for his fictional one; Clair's maiden name is Hanks, which she shares with Camille.	寇司比在他的虛構家庭中借用了他真實生活中的多個家人名字；克萊兒的娘家姓是漢克斯，與卡蜜兒相同。
The second season explores each character gaining more responsibility, none more-so than Clair, who is deliberately provided with more storylines to experience and new emotions to express in terms of her relationship with her husband and children.	第二季是探索各個角色獲得更多責任，尤其是克萊兒，她被刻意賦予了更多可體驗的故事情節，在與丈夫和孩子間的關係方面也有了新的情緒來表達。
Clair is portrayed by American actress Phylicia Rashad.	克萊兒是由美國女星菲莉西亞·拉沙德所飾演。
In addition to appearing in minor roles on both television and Broadway, Rashad had a recurring role as Courtney Wright on the soap opera One Life to Live before Cosby personally selected her to play his character's wife.	在寇司比親自選定拉沙德飾演他所演角色的妻子之前，她除了在電視和百老匯演出小角色以外，也在肥皂劇《僅此一生》中扮演常設角色寇特妮·懷特。
Several actresses auditioned for the role, the majority of whom tended to resort to angrily yelling and moving their heads in a manner similar to that of a bobblehead doll when scolding the child actors playing the character's children during their auditions.	多位女星參加了這個角色的徵選；徵選期間，大部分女星在責罵飾演該角色子女的兒童演員時，傾向於憤怒地大吼以及用類似搖頭人偶的方式搖動頭部。
However, Rashad's subtle interpretation was different from those of her competitors; when the actress screen tested opposite actor Malcolm Jamal-Warner, who would ultimately go on to portray son Theo, Rashad simply paused, stared and silently gave him "a look" instead of immediately scolding the character that, according to Cosby, meant "four or five things ... and none of them were good." At the end of Rashad's audition, Cosby announced "[Rashad is] Clair" to Carsey.	但是，拉沙德微妙的詮釋與競爭者不同；這位女星與最終與之後扮演兒子席奧的演員馬爾科姆-賈馬爾·華納進行對手戲試鏡時，拉沙德僅是停頓下來、瞪大眼睛且無聲地給他「一種眼神」，而不是立即責罵該角色；寇司比表示，那有「四或五種涵義……而且沒一個是好事。」拉沙德試鏡結束時，寇司比就向卡斯宣布「[拉沙德是] 克萊兒」。
Additionally, because Clair was still intended to be of Dominican heritage at the time, Rashad's own bilingualism and fluency in Spanish benefited her successful casting.	此外，因為當時仍然想讓克萊兒帶有多明尼加傳統，所以拉沙德本身精通雙語且西班牙語流利使她有利地成功演出。
Most of what is now NY 171 was improved to state highway standards as part of a project contracted out by the state of New York on July 12, 1916.	在 1916 年 7 月 12 日紐約州承包出去的專案中，現今為 NY 171 的大部分已依照州級公路標準進行提升。
The work covered the 5.10 miles (8.21 km) of the route outside of the Frankfort village limits.	工程涵蓋了法蘭克福特村邊界以外的 5.10 英哩 (8.21 公里) 路線。
The reconstruction was completed in the 1920s, and the Frankfort Gorge road was added to the state highway system as unsigned State Highway 1346 (SH 1346) by 1926.	重建工作在 1920 年代完成，而法蘭克福特峽谷路到 1926 年才以無符號州級公路 1346 (SH 1346) 加入州級公路系統。
In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, SH 1346 became part of NY 171, which continued northeast to Main Street in Frankfort on several state and locally maintained streets.	在 1930 年為紐約的州級公路重新編號時，SH 1346 變成 NY 171 的一部分，並在行經多個州級和由當地維護的街道後，繼續往東北方延伸到法蘭克福特的主街。
At the time, Main Street was part of NY 5S, another route assigned as part of the renumbering.	當時主街屬於 NY 5S，也就是在重新編號時分配的另一個路線。
In the late 1960s, a limited-access highway was constructed between Utica and Ilion alongside NY 5S. The new highway became part of a rerouted NY 5S in the early 1970s.	1960 年代後期，在由提卡和伊利翁之間沿著 NY 5S 建了一條禁止進入的公路。這條新的公路在 1970 年代初期變成改道後 NY 5S 的一部分。
As a result, NY 171, which does not interchange with the highway, no longer connects to any other signed state routes.	因此，未與這條公路交會的 NY 171 就不再連通到任何其他有標誌的州級路線。
NY 171 is the only signed state highway in New York that is completely isolated from the remainder of the state highway system.	NY 171 是紐約州唯一完全未連接州級公路系統中其他公路的有標誌州級公路。
In 1992, Sony submitted plans that required approval by the New York City Planning Commission, in which it would take some of the open space in the building's atrium that had been used to obtain approval for additional floors on top of the building, and convert those areas into retail space.	1992 年，索尼提交了需要紐約城市規劃委員會核准的計畫，其中會占用該大樓中庭的部分開放空間；該中庭當時已用來取得大樓頂樓額外樓層的核准，並將這些區域改成零售空間。
In exchange, the company would expand the glass-enclosed pedestrian walkway with the addition of planters and public seating.	作為交換條件，該公司會以增加植栽和公共座位等方式來擴充玻璃圍籬的行人步道。
Sony expected that the proposed conversion of the 8,727 sq ft (810.8 m²) of public space could be converted into stores that could be leased at rates that The New York Times estimated could approach $200 per square foot.	索尼預期，所提案的 8,727 平方英呎 (810.8 平方公尺) 公共空間轉換，能夠轉換成可供租賃的商店，且《紐約時報》估計租金可能將近每平方英呎 200 美元。
The company noted that the space was underutilized as a public amenity because it was "dark, windy and noisy" and that its conversion to commercial space would provide "retail continuity" with the remainder of Madison Avenue.	該公司注意到這個空間作為公共設施並未獲得充分利用，因為它「昏暗、風大且吵雜」，而且將它轉換成商業空間將提供與麥迪遜大道其他部分的「零售業連貫性」。
By 1996, Sony had consolidated most of the operations for its Sony Music Entertainment division at 550 Madison Avenue, for which The New York Times noted that "such high-profile and elaborate space is appropriate and necessary." That same year, Sony acquired additional space across the street at 555 Madison Avenue, a 445,000 sq ft (41,300 m²) building built in the 1960s that underwent renovations of its lobby, windows, bathrooms and other common spaces in conjunction with Sony's lease.	到了 1996 年，索尼已將旗下的索尼音樂娛樂部門大部分營運整合到麥迪遜大道 550 號，《紐約時報》對此指出，「如此高調且精緻的空間既適當且必要。」同一年，索尼取得對街麥迪遜大道 555 號的額外空間；這是一棟建造於 1960 年代的 445,000 平方英呎 (41,300 平方公尺) 大樓，並隨著索尼的租約進行其大廳、窗戶、浴室和其他公共空間的翻新。
Sony signed leases through 2013 on an additional 90,000 sq ft (8,400 m²) on the sixth through ninth floors of the building, on top of an initial rental of 90,000 sq ft (8,400 m²) of space on the second through fifth floors of the building that it had made in 1995.	繼 1995 年一開始租用該大樓二到五樓 90,000 平方英呎 (8,400 平方公尺) 的空間之後，索尼又在該大樓六到九樓的額外 90,000 平方英呎 (8,400 平方公尺) 簽訂為期至 2013 年的租約。
Rents on the floors had averaged about $34 per square foot at the time.	當時這些樓層的租金平均約為每平方英呎 34 美元。
Sony connected the two buildings using fiber optic cables that were run under Madison Avenue and installed microwave communications equipment on the top of the 555 building.	索尼使用穿越麥迪遜大道下方的光纖纜線連接這兩棟大樓，並在 555 號大樓樓頂安裝了微波通訊設備。
Sony made these moves, which included early termination of leases on space in the surrounding area at 711 Fifth Avenue on the 43rd floor at 9 West 57th Street, as part of an effort to lower occupancy costs by bringing its businesses closer together.	索尼為了盡可能緊密集中業務來降低占用成本而進行這些動作，包括提前終止西 57 街 9 號 43 樓 (第五大道 711 號) 周邊區域空間的租約。
A cash-strapped AT&T sold the building to Sony in 2002 for $236 million, or $315 per square foot.	資金短缺的 AT&T 在 2002 年將該大樓以 2 億 3600 萬美元出售給索尼，也就是每平方英呎 315 美元。
The building incorporated the Sony Wonder Technology Lab, a multimedia hands-on tour through the world of media, located in a four-story annex accessible through a glass-roofed atrium that connects 55th and 56th Streets in mid-block.	這棟大樓併入了以多媒體實作導覽媒體世界的索尼奇幻科技實驗室 (位於四層樓附屬建築物內)，可透過連接街區中段第 55 和 56 街的玻璃屋頂中庭進入。
It was open on Tuesdays through Saturdays, and Sony described the free exhibits as a "technology and entertainment museum for all ages".	它在星期二到星期六間開放，而且索尼將免費的展覽形容為「適合全年齡的科技和娛樂博物館」。
During 2008, the museum's third and fourth floors underwent renovations that were completed in fall 2008.	2008 年間，該博物館的三樓和四樓進行了翻新，於 2008 年秋天完工。
Sony Wonder replaced Infoquest Center, a permanent telecommunications exhibition that had been built by AT&T.	索尼奇幻世界取代了 AT&T 先前設立的常設電子通訊展覽館 Infoquest 中心。
Sony permanently closed the lab on January 29, 2016.	索尼在 2016 年 1 月 29 日永久關閉了該實驗室。
On February 27, 2010, an accumulation of ice from the February 25–27, 2010 North American blizzard broke loose from an upper floor, breaking the glass ceiling of the atrium and injuring at least 15 inside who were attending a Purim celebration.	2010 年 2 月 27 日，在 2 月 25 到 27 日的 2010 北美暴風雪期間累積的冰層從上方樓層破裂掉落，擊破了中庭的玻璃天花板，並造成至少 15 位正在其中參加普珥節慶祝活動的人受傷。
In December 2012, bidding started on the building and in January 2013 Sony announced plans to sell the building to the Chetrit Group for $1.1 billion – $685 million more than it had paid for it.	2012 年 12 月開始有人對該大樓競標，而在 2013 年 1 月，索尼宣布以 11 億美元將該大樓出售給切特里特集團的計畫，比索尼當初支付的金額多了 6 億 8500 萬美元。
Sony leased back its offices there through 2016, when it moved its headquarters south to 11 Madison Avenue.	索尼將其位於該處的辦公室租回，一直到 2016 年將總部南移至麥迪遜大道 11 號為止。
The Chetrit Group planned to redevelop the building as a combination of condominiums and a hotel.	切特里特集團規劃將該大樓重建成公寓和旅館的組合。
Chetrit abandoned this plan and sold the building to Olayan and Chelsfield in 2016, relinquishing the "Sony Tower" name.	切特里特在 2016 年放棄了此計畫，並以讓與「索尼大廈」名稱的方式，將該大樓出售給奧拉揚和切斯特菲爾德。
McNicoll relinquished command of HMAS Australia in July 1954 before the cruiser was paid off and marked for disposal the following month, and he briefly returned to duties at the Navy Office.	麥克尼科在 1954 年 7 月艦艇遭到清償並標記為廢棄的前一個月交出了澳洲皇家海軍的指揮權，並短暫地回到海軍部擔任職務。
In November, he embarked for London to attend the Imperial Defence College as part of the 1955 course intake, which signified that he had been marked for senior command. McNicoll and his wife, Ruth, had separated in 1950 and their divorce, which cited adultery as the cause, was finalised in October 1956, while the former was still in London.	11 月，他因為加入 1955 年課程而出發前往倫敦就讀帝國國防大學；這表示他當時已具備資深指揮官的身分。麥克尼科及妻子茹絲在 1950 年分居，並在 1956 年 10 月以通姦為由確定離婚，當時前者仍在倫敦。
On 17 May the following year, McNicoll wed Frances Mary Chadwick, a journalist, in the Hampstead register office.	隔年的 5 月 17 日，麥克尼科在漢普斯特德結婚登記處與新聞工作者法蘭西絲·瑪莉·查德威克法蘭西絲結為連理。
Made acting rear admiral in January 1957, McNicoll was appointed as Head of the Australian Joint Service Staff in London.	麥克尼科在 1957 年 1 月成為代理少將後，在倫敦獲任澳洲聯合參謀長。
He returned to Australia in February 1958 and was selected to serve as Deputy Secretary (Military) at the Department of Defence; McNicoll's rank was made substantive in July that year.	他在 1958 年 2 月返回澳洲，並獲任國防部 (軍隊) 副部長；麥克尼科的軍階在該年的 7 月成為終身頭銜。
On 8 January 1960, McNicoll was posted to the Naval Board in Canberra as Second Naval Member and Chief of Personnel.	1960 年 1 月 8 日，麥克尼科被分發到坎培拉的海軍局擔任副海軍司令官暨人事局長。
As noted by historian Ian Pfennigwerth, McNicoll held this position at a time in which recruitment and retention in the Navy particularly lagged behind targets.	如歷史學家伊恩·芬尼格維斯所記載，麥克尼科擔任此職位的時期是海軍徵才及留任特別不及目標的時期。
McNicoll was additionally appointed as a trustee of the RAN Relief Trust Fund during this period.	麥克尼科在這段期間又另獲任澳洲皇家海軍救濟信託基金的受託管理人。
Completing his term on the Naval Board, McNicoll was posted as Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet on 8 January 1962 and hoisted his standard aboard HMAS Melbourne, the flagship of the RAN.	麥克尼科完成海軍局的任期後，在 1962 年 1 月 8 日獲派任為澳洲皇家艦隊海軍司令部總司令官，並在澳洲皇家海軍的主艦 (墨爾本號航空母艦) 上升起他的軍旗。
The Australian government had designated the role of the RAN to be primarily one of anti-submarine warfare, a posture which McNicoll thought unwise.	澳洲政府將澳洲皇家海軍指定為反潛作戰的首要角色，但麥克尼科認為此舉並不明智。
McNicoll argued that surface and air weapons posed a threat equal to that of submarines toward vessels in modern naval warfare.	麥克尼科主張，在現代海軍作戰中，地面及空中武器對船艦構成的威脅與潛艇構成的威脅相等。
As such, he campaigned for a contemporary aircraft carrier to replace that of HMAS Melbourne.	因此，他爭取以當代航空母艦來取代墨爾本號航空母艦。
The Army and Air Force opposed McNicoll's stance, and the government ultimately concluded that there was no strategic requirement for a new carrier in light of agreements contained in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.	陸軍與空軍都反對麥克尼科的立場，而政府最終裁定，依照東南亞公約組織中包含的協議，策略上並無新的航空母艦需求。
In any event, McNicoll experienced a particularly demanding tenure as Fleet Commander since the RAN was in the process of a complete overhaul of its order of battle and, as a consequence, he had to manage the introduction and deployment into service of six Ton-class minesweepers acquired from the Royal Navy, along with the first batch of Westland Wessex helicopters and modernised afloat support capabilities.	無論如何，麥克尼科擔任艦隊指揮官時都經歷了特別嚴苛的任期，因為當時澳洲皇家海軍正在對其戰鬥序列進行全面檢修，因此他必須著手推動和部署向皇家海軍取得的六噸級掃雷艇，以及第一批威塞克斯式直昇機和新式海上運補能力等的服役工作。
Furthermore, McNicoll was charged with the responsibility of ensuring Australian naval commitments to the Far East Strategic Reserve were met.	此外，麥克尼科還必須負責確保澳洲海軍實現對遠東戰略預備隊的承諾。
McNicoll's two-year term as Fleet Commander concluded on 6 January 1964, at which point he returned to the Naval Board as Fourth Naval Member and Chief of Supply.	麥克尼科的艦隊指揮官兩年任期於 1964 年 1 月 6 日結束，當時便返回海軍局擔任第四海軍成員兼補給長。
However, this post proved short-lived with his appointment as Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area, headquartered at the land base HMAS Kuttabul in Sydney, from June that year.	但是，這個職位不過是曇花一現，因為他從該年的 6 月就獲任東澳區艦隊司令官，總部設在雪梨的澳洲皇家海軍艦艇庫塔布爾的地面基地。
In the 1965 New Year Honours, McNicoll was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.	在 1965 年的新年授勛中，麥克尼科獲頒巴斯同袍勳章。
On 24 February 1965, McNicoll was promoted vice admiral and made Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) in succession to Vice Admiral Sir Hastings Harrington.	1965 年 2 月 24 日，麥克尼科晉升為副上將，並接替副上將赫斯廷斯·哈靈頓爵士的海軍參謀 (CNS) 一職。
By virtue of this position, McNicoll was head of the Naval Board and the functional commander of the RAN. McNicoll's term as CNS was characterised by a period of heightened activity for the RAN in light of the Australian commitments to the Indonesia–Malaysia Konfrontasi and the Vietnam War.	因為這個職位，麥克尼科成為海軍局局長以及澳洲皇家海軍的職掌指揮官。麥克尼科的 CNS 任期特點在於，由於澳洲對印尼-馬來西亞對抗及越戰有所承諾，因此澳洲皇家海軍在該時期提高了軍事活動。
The first movement is longer and more complex than any that Mozart had previously composed in the concerto genre.	第一樂章比莫札特先前在協奏曲類別中作過的任何曲子更慢且更複雜。
It is in ; among Mozart's 27 piano concertos, No. 4 in G Major, No.	它使用了 G 大調第 4 號、
11 in F major and No. 14 in E♭ major are the only others to commence in triple metre.	F 大調 11 號，和 E♭ 大調第 14 號，是莫札特 27 部唯一以三拍子開始的鋼琴協奏曲之一。
The first movement follows the standard outline of a sonata form concerto movement of the Classical period.	第一樂章遵循了古典音樂時期奏鳴曲式協奏曲樂章的標準輪廓。
It begins with an orchestral exposition, which is followed by a solo exposition, a development section, a recapitulation, a cadenza and a coda.	它以管弦樂呈示部為開頭，之後是獨奏呈示部、發展部、再現部、裝飾樂段和尾奏。
Within this conventional outline, Mozart engages in extensive structural innovation.	在這個傳統的輪廓內，莫札特投入了密集的結構創新。
The development begins with the piano repeating its entry to the solo exposition, this time in the relative major of E♭.	發展部以鋼琴重複進入獨奏呈示部的方式開頭，但這次是以相對的 E♭ 大調。
The Concerto No. 20 is the only other of Mozart's concertos in which the solo exposition and the development commence with the same material.	在莫札特的協奏曲中，第 20 號協奏曲是唯一另一個在獨奏呈示部和發展部使用相同素材開始的協奏曲。
In the Concerto No. 24, the material unfolds in the development in a manner different from the solo exposition: the opening solo motif, with its half cadence, is repeated four times, with one intervention from the woodwinds, as if asking question after question.	在第 24 號鋼琴協奏曲中，發展部的素材以不同於獨奏呈示部的方式展開：開場的獨奏動機及其裝飾樂段重複四次，並插入一次木管樂器，彷彿一再詢問問題一樣。
The final question is asked in C minor and is answered by a descending scale from the piano that leads to an orchestral statement, in F minor, of the movement's principal theme.	最後一個問題是以 C 小調提問，並以鋼琴的下行音階回答，以 F 小調進入樂章主題的管弦樂陳述。
The orchestral theme is then developed: the motif of the theme's fourth and fifth measures descends through the circle of fifths, accompanied by an elaborate piano figuration.	接著發展出管弦樂主題：主題第四和第五小節的動機透過五度圈下行，並伴隨著精心安排的鋼琴音型法。
After this, the development proceeds to a stormy exchange between the piano and the orchestra, which the twentieth-century Mozart scholar Cuthbert Girdlestone describes as "one of the few [occasions] in Mozart where passion seems really unchained", and which Tovey describes as a passage of "fine, severe massiveness".	在此之後，發展部開展成鋼琴和管弦樂之間的激烈交錯；二十世紀的莫札特學者卡斯伯特·吉德爾史東將此形容為「少數在其中似乎真正釋放出熱情 [時刻] 的莫札特作品之一」，托維則是將其形容為一段「精美、凜冽的沉重感」。
The exchange resolves to a passage in which the piano plays a treble line of sixteenth notes, over which the winds add echoes of the main theme.	這段交換消退成鋼琴以十六分音符的高音譜線演奏，其上則有管樂加上主題的回聲。
This transitional passage ultimately modulates to the home key of C minor, bringing about the start of the recapitulation with the conventional re-statement, by the orchestra, of the movement's principal theme.	這個轉調的段落最終變調為 C 小調的主調，透過樂章的主要主題──管弦樂，以傳統的回歸段帶進再現部的開頭。
The wide range of thematic material presented in the orchestral and solo expositions poses a challenge for the recapitulation.	管弦和獨奏呈示部中呈現的廣泛主題素材，為再現部帶來了挑戰。
Mozart manages to recapitulate all of the themes in the home key of C minor.	莫札特得心應手地以 C 小調主調再現所有主題。
The themes are necessarily compressed, are presented in a different order, and in their restated form, contain few virtuosic moments for the soloist.	這些主題必須有所壓縮、以不同順序呈現，而且在其回歸再現形式中，含有獨奏者少有的巧奪天工瞬間。
The last theme to be recapitulated is the secondary theme of the orchestral exposition, which has not been heard for some 400 measures and is now adorned by a passage of triplets from the piano.	再現的最後一個主題是管弦樂呈示部的副主題；這個副主題已有約 400 小節未出現，現在則是透過鋼琴三連音的段落來裝飾。
The recapitulation concludes with the piano playing arpeggiated sixteenths before a cadential trill leads into a ritornello.	再現部的結尾是鋼琴演奏十六分音符琶音，之後則是以一個終止顫音進入結尾段。
The ritornello in turn leads into a fermata that prompts the soloist's cadenza.	結尾段接著進入延長音，以提示獨奏者的終止式。
"All of Creation" was nominated for two awards at the 42nd GMA Dove Awards: "Song of the Year" and "Pop/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year".	《All of Creation》獲得第 42 屆 GMA 金鴿獎兩項提名：「年度最佳歌曲」和「年度最佳流行/當代歌曲」。
It was also nominated for "Christian Song of the Year" at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards.	它也在 2011 年告示牌音樂獎中獲得「年度基督教歌曲」提名。
"The Ones" was written by co-executive producer Jack Burditt, and directed by Beth McCarthy, a long-time television director who worked with series creator Tina Fey on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live.	《The Ones》由共同執行製作人傑克·布迪特編劇，並由曾與劇集創作者蒂娜·費在喜劇小品節目週六夜現場合作的資深導播貝絲·麥卡錫執導。
This was Burditt's tenth writing credit, and was McCarthy's sixth directed episode.	這是布迪特的第十部編劇創作，而且是麥卡錫第六部執導的影集。
"The Ones" originally aired on NBC in the United States on April 23, 2009.	《The Ones》最初在 2009 年 4 月 23 日於美國的 NBC 播出。
At the beginning of the episode, Jack and Liz are at a jewelry store, as Jack is searching for an engagement ring for Elisa.	影集的開頭時，傑克和莉茲在珠寶店，因為傑克正在尋找給愛莉莎的訂婚戒指。
They shot that scene in a Cartier store in New York's Fifth Avenue, which was filmed on February 22, 2009. A scene featuring Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway) as the Grim Reaper, in which Jenna is led to believe Kenneth has gone into shock because of the strawberries, was cut from the airing.	他們在紐約第五大道的卡地亞商店拍攝該場景，在 2009 年 2 月 22 日拍攝。一場由蘇·拉羅切·范德豪特 (蘇·加洛維) 扮演死神，且其中珍娜被引導認為肯尼斯是因為草莓而進入休克狀態的場景，並沒有播出。
According to Jane Krakowski, in the DVD commentary for this episode, there were alternate scenes with Jenna letting Kenneth know about the tampering she did to Kenneth's items, his chickpea, water bottle, and harmonica.	根據珍·考克斯基在此影集的 DVD 講評中所述，替代的場景是珍娜讓肯尼斯知道她對肯尼斯的物品搞鬼，也就是他的鷹嘴豆、水瓶和口琴。
"The Ones" was actress Salma Hayek's final guest appearance on 30 Rock.	《The Ones》是女演員莎瑪·海耶克在超級製作人的最後一次客串演出。
Her first appearance on the show was in the episode "Señor Macho Solo", as a nurse for Jack's mother and love interest for him.	她在節目中的首次演出是在《Señor Macho Solo》一集，扮演傑克母親的護士而且對他有愛慕之情。
She next guest-starred in the episodes "Flu Shot", "Generalissimo", "St.	她之後客串演出了《流感疫苗》、《大元帥》、
Valentine's Day", and "Larry King".	《情人節》和《賴瑞·金》等集。
News anchor Brian Williams, of NBC Nightly News, guest-starred as himself in this episode.	NBC 夜間新聞主播布萊恩·威廉斯在此影集中客串演出自己。
In a scene with Tracy and Jack at a club, Tracy reveals to Jack that he has been giving out his phone number to different women, though it is not his real number, which results in Williams receiving the calls.	在崔西和傑克位於俱樂部的一個場景中，崔西向傑克透露，他一直把電話號碼提供給不同的女人，但是那並非他真正的號碼，因此導致威廉斯接到電話。
Kenneth revealing that his real name is "Dick Whitman" is a reference to the main character Don Draper of Mad Men (played by Jon Hamm, who had a recurring role on 30 Rock earlier in the season).	肯尼斯透露他的真實姓名是「迪克·惠特曼」，是影射《廣告狂人》的主角唐·德雷柏 (由喬·漢姆扮演，他在超級製作人當季早期擔任常設角色)。
"Earn this", spoken by Kenneth as Jenna has poisoned him again, references the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan when actor Tom Hanks says the same words to actor Matt Damon's title character.	肯尼斯在珍娜再度對他下毒時說的「好好活下去」，是影射 1998 年電影《搶救雷恩大兵》，當時演員湯姆·漢克斯對演員麥特·戴蒙扮演的主角說了同樣的話。
When she is told that Kenneth has gone into a severe allergic shock and needs to have his hands cut off, Jenna apologizes to him for what she has done, telling him "I'm just a girl sitting in front of a boy she poisoned so this other guy would go to town on her", which Jenna misquotes from actress Julia Roberts' character from the romantic comedy Notting Hill (1999).	她得知肯尼斯進入嚴重過敏休克且必須將雙手切除時，珍娜因為所做的事而向他道歉，並告訴他「我只是個女孩，坐在一位她下毒的男孩面前，好讓另外一個傢伙盡情享用她」，這是珍娜錯誤引用了浪漫喜劇《新娘百分百》(1999) 中女演員茱莉亞·羅勃茲的話。
After Kenneth drinks his strawberry water, as he risked his life so that Jenna can meet the paramedic again, Jenna says to Kenneth "You magnificent sonofabitch!", a line quoted by actor George C. Scott in the American biographical war film Patton (1970).	肯尼斯喝下他的草莓水後，因為他冒生命危險讓珍娜能夠再次見到急救人員，潔娜向肯尼斯說「你真是超棒的王八蛋！」，這是引用演員喬治 C·史考特在美國傳記電影《巴頓將軍》(1970) 中的台詞。
Kenneth blows white smoke out while referencing bringing back something from "the other side" (death) echoes the same look when actor Haley Joel Osment remarked "I see dead people" in the movie The Sixth Sense (1999).	肯尼斯提到從「另外一邊」(死亡) 取回某個物品時吐出白煙，是模仿演員海利·喬·奧斯蒙在電影《靈異第六感》(1999) 中說出「我看得見死人」時的相同模樣。
The final three clips in the montage of Tracy taking off his shirt are real clips from Tracy Morgan interviews.	崔西脫掉上衣的剪輯中最後的三個片段是來自崔西·摩根訪談的真實片段。
Also, Elisa wears a "What the Frak?!" Battlestar Galactica t-shirt, as she admits her secret to Jack and Liz. "It's not product placement—I just like it!", says Liz to Jack, after he storms into her office and she is wearing a Slanket, a sleeved blanket with sleeves usually made of fleece material.	此外，艾莉莎向傑克和莉茲坦承祕密時，穿著一件「What the Frak?!」《星際大爭霸》T 恤。傑克衝進莉茲的辦公室之後，她對他說「它不是替代產品，我只是很喜歡它！」，而且她穿著袖毯，是一種帶袖子的毛毯，且袖子通常以羊毛材質製成。
In its original American broadcast, "The Ones" was watched by 6.3 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system.	根據尼爾森收視率系統，《The Ones》最初在美國的播出有 630 萬戶收看。
Caesium is a relatively rare element, estimated to average 3 parts per million in the Earth's crust.	銫是一種相對稀有的元素，預估在地殼中平均為百萬分之 3。
It is the 45th most abundant element and the 36th among the metals.	它是第 45 種最豐富的元素，在金屬中則是第 36 名。
Nevertheless, it is more abundant than such elements as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, and two orders of magnitude more abundant than mercury and silver; it is 3.3% as abundant as rubidium, with which it is closely associated, chemically.	然而，它比銻、鎘、錫和鎢等元素豐度更高，而且比汞和銀的豐度多了兩個量級；它的豐度和銣一樣是 3.3%，而且與它在化學上密切相關。
Due to its large ionic radius, caesium is one of the "incompatible elements".	銫的離子半徑很大，因此是「不相容元素」的其中一種。
During magma crystallization, caesium is concentrated in the liquid phase and crystallizes last.	在岩漿結晶期間，銫會濃縮成液相，並在最後結晶。
Therefore, the largest deposits of caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process.	因此，銫的最大礦床是這種富集過程中形成的晶帶偉晶岩礦體。
Because caesium does not substitute for potassium as readily as rubidium does, the alkali evaporite minerals sylvite (KCl) and carnallite (KMgCl	因為銫無法像銣一樣容易取代鉀，鹼蒸發岩礦鉀鹽 (KCl) 和光鹵石 (KMgCl

Consequently, caesium is found in few minerals.	因此，很少礦物質中會發現銫。
Percentage amounts of caesium may be found in beryl (Be	有一部分的銫可能存在於綠柱石 (Be

A major theme in this story is that of a symbiotic relationship between a planet and its inhabitants, similar to that in The Word for World Is Forest.	此故事的主要題材是星球和其居民之間的共生關係，與《世界的詞語是森林》中的共生關係類似。
In her introduction to the story, Le Guin stated "We all have forests in our minds.	在勒瑰恩的故事引言中，她表示「我們的心中都有森林。
Forests unexplored, unending.	未經探索，無止盡的森林。
Each of us gets lost in the forests, every night, alone." The "vegetable love" referred to in the poem from which the title is taken can be used to describe the final relationship between Osden and the planetary intelligence of World 4470.	我們每個人每晚都會獨自迷失在森林中。」在詩名取自其中的詩集中，所提到的「植物般的愛情」可以用來形容世界 4470 中奧斯登和星球智慧之間的最終關係。
When Osden is attacked by Porlock in the planet, he transmits his fear to the planet, which amplifies it and reflects it back at him.	奧斯登在星球上受到波拉克攻擊時，他將恐懼傳送給星球，而星球將它放大並反射回來給他。
Thus Osden's role is similar to that of Selver in The Word for World is Forest, in that he introduces violence to the forest world.	因此奧斯登的角色類似於《世界的詞語是森林》中的塞爾沃爾，他在其中將暴力引進森林世界。
The intelligence of Le Guin's forest has been contrasted to the "low" position occupied by vegetative beings in the works of other science fiction authors such as Arthur C. Clarke.	勒瑰恩的森林智慧與亞瑟·C·克拉克等其他科幻作者作品中由植物佔據的「低等」位置成為對比。
An additional similarity between The Word for World Is Forest and "Vaster than Empires" is the theme of first contact between humans and a new environment.	另一個在世界的詞語是森林和「比帝國遼闊」之間的相似處，是人類和新環境首次接觸的題材。
In "Vaster than Empires," the forest is both the setting for the story and a character in it.	在「比帝國遼闊」中，森林同時是故事的背景，也是其中的角色。
The forest directly responds to the humans with fear, a response that is similar to the response of Osden, the empath, to the rest of society: "the normal defensive-aggressive reaction between strangers meeting." Thus Le Guin makes an analogy between contact between humans and aliens, and contact between individual humans; both are contact between the self and the "other".	森林直接以恐懼回應人類，一種類似於共感人奧斯登對社會其他人的反應：「陌生人見面時的正常防禦性攻擊反應。」因此勒瑰恩將人類與外星人之間的接觸，和個別人類之間的接觸進行類比；兩者都是自我和「他者」之間的接觸。
Osden is depicted as having a strong empathetic connection with the vegetated planet visited by the explorers.	奧斯登被描述為與探索者所造訪的植物星球有強烈的移情作用連結。
This is in contrast to the sharply antagonistic relationship that the other members of the team have with him.	這和團隊其他成員與他的鮮明矛盾關係成了對比。
The team is depicted as a dysfunctional group, with each individual having quirks and oddities of their own.	團隊被描述為功能失調的群體，每個人都有自己的怪癖和古怪之處。
They are regarded as being of "unsound mind" by the people of Earth and Hain, because they were willing to travel on a voyage that lasted 500 years of actual time.	他們被地球和海恩的人視為「心理不健全」的人，因為他們願意踏上實際時間長達 500 年的航程。
The fear transmitted by the forest drives them further into their neuroticism.	森林傳送的恐懼讓他們的神經質更為嚴重。
In contrast, Osden the empath surrenders completely to the forest, and thus achieves a mental unity with the planet.	相比之下，共感人奧斯登徹底向森林屈服，因此與星球達到精神統一。
In choosing a sort of union with the planet, Osden shows that the singular consciousness of the vegetative creature is preferable to the chaos and discord in human society.	在選擇與星球統一的方法時，奧斯登展現出植物的單一意識比人類社會的混亂與不和諧更好。
At the conclusion of the story Tomiko describes Osden's relationship with the planet, saying "He had taken the fear into himself, and, accepting, had transcended it.	在故事的結尾，Tomiko 描述 Osdens 與地球的關係，他說：「他感到恐懼，繼而接受且超越恐懼。
He had given up his self to the alien, and unreserved surrender, that left no place for evil.	面對外星人，他放棄自我，徹底投降，使邪惡毫無立足之地。
He had learned the love of the Other and thereby had been given his whole self." Osden achieves a completely empathetic relationship with the planet, "both literally and figuratively in touch with the forest;" which also grants him temporary goodwill towards humans, as he says "Listen, I will you well" before leaving his colleagues.	他學會了愛他人，從而使自已更完美。Osden 與地球達成完全同理心的關係，「無論是字面上還是比喻上與森林的接觸；」這也使他展現對人類暫時的善意，因為他在離開同事之前說「聴著，我希望您幸福」。
Immediately after CR 557 joins US 40, the road enters Buena, Atlantic County and continues southeast into inhabited areas.	在 CR 557 與 US 40 交會之後，這條路立即進入大西洋郡布埃納 (Buena, Atlantic County)，並繼續向東南方向進入有人居住的地區。
After running through the commercial center of town, where it crosses the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Southern Running Track line, the road comes to the southern terminus of Route 54 and the eastern end of CR 619 in a business area located on the outskirts.	穿過城鎮的商業中心後，旋即穿過新澤西州南方鐵路的南部道路線 (Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Southern Running Track)，到達 54 號公路的南部終點和 CR 619 的東端，這是位於郊區的商業區。

Route 50 joins US 40 before the road crosses the Great Egg Harbor River.	50 號公路與 US 40 交匯，然後穿過巨蛋港河 (Great Egg Harbor River)。
Upon crossing the river, the road enters Mays Landing and turns north into the downtown area.	這條路在穿過河後進入梅斯蘭丁 (Mays Landing)，向北轉進入市區。
CR 559 Truck splits southbound to follow CR 617 to the east.	CR 559 Truck 向南分道而沿循 CR 617 向東延伸。
A short distance later, the road meets CR 559 and US 40 splits from Route 50 by turning east onto that route.	在延伸很短的距離後，這條路與 CR 559 交會，而 US 40 向東轉入該條路而與 50 號公路分道。
This intersection marks the beginning of CR 559 Truck northbound.	此交叉路口標記 CR 559 Truck 北行的起點。
The road passes more development before CR 559 splits from the road by heading southeast.	這條路會先通過更多開發區，然後 CR 559 向東南方延伸而與這條路分道。
US 40 heads east out of Mays Landing, where it continues through woodland and increasing residential development.	US 40 向東延伸而離開梅斯蘭丁 (Mays Landing)，在此處繼續穿過林地和愈來愈多的住宅開發區。
The road widens into four lanes as it comes to US 322 (Black Horse Pike) near the Hamilton Mall.	這條路隨著在漢密爾頓購物中心 (Hamilton Mall) 附近到達 US 322 (Black Horse Pike) 而拓寬成四條車道。
At this point, US 40 forms a concurrency with US 322, which lasts for the remainder of the route.	在此處，US 40 與 US 322 形成並行道路，這條路的其餘部分持續並行。
The two routes continue to the southeast through business areas, meeting CR 575 and a ramp to the Atlantic City Expressway.	這兩條路繼續向東南穿過商業區，與 CR 575 和通往大西洋高速公路 (Atlantic City Expressway) 的匝道交匯。
CR 575 turns east to follow US 40/US 322.	CR 575 向東轉而沿循 US 40/US 322 延伸。
Sixteen years before Oceanic 815 crashes on the island, Rousseau was a heavily pregnant member of a six-person crew aboard a French research vessel three days out of Tahiti.	在大洋航空 815 航班 (Oceanic 815) 墜毀在島上的十六年前，盧梭是一艘法國研究船離開大溪地的三天航程中，六名船員中的一名臨產期成員。
The crew picked up a radio signal emanating from the South Pacific, which was a repeating set of six numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42.	船員接收到從南太平洋發出的無線電信號，信號中重複一組六個數字：4、8、15、16、23 和 42。
While attempting to find the source of the signal, the ship ran aground on rocks surrounding the island.	這艘船在試圖找到信號來源時，擱淺在島嶼周圍的岩石上。
Before reaching the shore, Rousseau and her team found Oceanic 815 survivor Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) in the water, who had been time-travelling as a result of the time shifts which had been moving him and the flight survivors through the island's history.	在到達岸邊之前，盧梭及其隊員在水中找到歷經時光旅行的 Oceanic 815 倖存者權真秀 (金大賢飾)，他與航班倖存者因時光平移而一直穿越該島的歷史。
Rousseau later tells the survivors of Oceanic 815 that two months after their arrival, that the island natives, which she called the Others, carried a disease that the rest of her crew had contracted.	盧梭後來告訴 Oceanic 815 倖存者，在他們到達島上兩個月後，島上的原住民 (她稱為其他人) 是一種疾病的帶原者，而她的其他船員都感染了這種疾病。
She believed that this disease could not be allowed to reach the rest of the world, so she killed her colleagues, including her husband Robert.	她認為這種疾病不能傳播到世界其他地方，所以她殺死了她的同事，包括她的丈夫 Robert。
When Jin time-travels to the past, he witnesses a different version of Rousseau's past.	當真秀時光旅行到過去時，他見證了盧梭過往的不同版本。
It is shown that the Smoke Monster, not the Others, was responsible for the "sickness" that forced her to kill her crew.	這表明，迫使她殺死其他船員的禍首就是煙怪，而不是其他人。
Rousseau confronts the father of her child, Robert, at gunpoint and accuses him of "being changed" inside the temple.	盧梭與她孩子父親羅伯特在槍口下對峙，並指責他在神廟內「被改變」。
Robert denies this, explaining that the Monster is a security system for the temple, and convinces Rousseau to lower her weapon.	羅伯特否定此說詞，而且解釋煙怪是神廟的保安系統，並說服盧梭放下武器。
He attempts to shoot her when she does, but is shot by Rousseau.	當她照做時，他試圖開槍打死她，但被盧梭槍殺了。
Rousseau also attempts to kill Jin, having witnessed him vanish moments after her team entered the Smoke Monster's lair, believing he has the disease.	盧梭還試圖殺死真秀，因為在她的團隊進入煙怪的巢穴後，她目睹真秀消失刹那，相信他已患有這種疾病。
Rousseau hiked to the radio tower and changed the message from the numbers to a repeating distress call. Three days later, Rousseau gave birth to a daughter, Alexandra.	盧梭徙步足到無線電塔，將訊息從數字改變成重複的求救電話。三天後，盧梭生下一名女兒艾莉克斯。
One week after Alex's birth, Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) came and took Alex from Rousseau.	艾莉克斯出生一週後，班傑明·萊納斯 (Michael Emerson 飾) 抵達且將艾莉克斯從盧梭帶走。
Ben told Rousseau that the child would be safe with them, and that she was lucky for being left alive.	班告訴盧梭，孩子和他們在一起會很安全，能幸運活著。
Before leaving, Ben tells her that if she hears whispers, she should run the other way.	在離開之前，班告訴她，如果她聴竊竊私語，應該往另一方向跑。
After this, Rousseau began setting traps in the jungle with the hope of catching one of the people responsible for Alex's kidnapping.	之後，盧梭開始在叢林中設置陷阱，希望抓住一名參與綁架艾莉克斯的人。
Rousseau makes her first appearance in the season one episode "Solitary", where she captures Sayid (Naveen Andrews), one of the plane crash survivors.	盧梭在第一季的《孤獨》(Solitary) 中首次亮相，在該集中，她抓住了飛機失事倖存者之一薩伊德 (Naveen Andrews 飾)。

Among harem-holding species, the adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more promiscuous and the males have larger testes for sperm competition.	在擁有配偶群的物種中，成年雌性僅與配偶群中的種公馬交配，而在其他物種中，交配更為混雜，為了爭取交配機會，雄性具有較大的睾丸。
Estrus in female equines lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and swollen, everted labia.	雌馬發情會持續 5–10 天；體徵包括頻尿、流動黏液及陰唇腫脹外翻。
In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread and raise their tails when in the presence of a male.	此外，發情的雌性在雄性面前時，會張開後腳站立並抬起尾巴。
Males assess the female's reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in.	雄性會依據雌性反應來評估雌性的生殖狀態，雌性會後退來尋求交配。
Length of gestation varies by species; it is roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares come into estrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions.	妊娠時間因物種而異，約 11 至 13 個月，大多數母馬在產駒後幾天內就可再次進入發情期，視狀況而定。
Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour.	通常，只有一匹馬駒出生，且剛出生的馬駒在一小時內就能夠奔跑。
Within a few weeks, foals attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months.	幼駒在幾週內就會嘗試吃草，但可能繼續餵養 8–13 個月。
Species in arid habitats, like Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.	如細紋斑馬等乾旱棲息地的物種，幼駒需要更長的哺乳期，直到三個月才喝水。
Among harem-holding species, foals are cared for mostly by their mothers, but if threatened by predators, the entire group works together to protect all the young.	在擁有雌性配偶群的物種中，幼駒主要由親生母親照顧，但如果受到捕食者威脅，整個馬群會共同努力保護所有幼駒。
The group forms a protective front with the foals in the center and the stallion will rush at predators that come too close.	馬群會形成保護陣線，將幼駒圍在中心，種公馬會衝向距離太近的捕食者。
In territory-holding species, mothers may gather into small groups and leave their young in "kindergartens" under the guard of a territorial male while searching for water.	在擁有領地的物種，母親會聚集成小群體，而幼駒留在「幼稚園」且受到領地雄性的警戒保護，同時尋找水源。
Grévy's zebra stallions may look after a foal in his territory to ensure that the mother stays, though it may not be his.	細紋斑馬種公馬會為了確保幼駒母親留下來而照顧領地內的一匹幼駒，即使不是親生的。
The earliest archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to around 4000-3500 BC.	烏克蘭和哈薩克的遺址存在最早的馬馴化考古證據，可追溯到西元前 4000-3500 年左右。
By 3000 BC, the horse was completely domesticated, and by 2000 BC, a sharp increase occurred in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent.	到西元前 3000 年，馬被完全馴化，到西元前 2000 年，在歐洲西北部的人類定居點中發現的馬骨數量急遽增加，表明馴養的馬遍佈大陸。
The most recent, but most irrefutable, evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were buried with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BC.	最近但最無可辯駁的馬馴化證據來自在西元前 2100 年的辛塔什塔 (Sintashta) 和彼得羅夫卡 (Petrovka) 文化的墳墓中發現到馬匹遺骸與戰車埋葬在一起。
Studies of variation in genetic material shows that very few wild stallions, possibly all from a single haplotype, contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds.	遺傳物質變異方面的研究表明，很少有野生種馬 (可能全部來自單倍型) 對家馬有貢獻，而許多母馬是早期馴化馬群的一部分。
Przewalski's horse has been conclusively shown not to be an ancestor of the domestic horse, though the two can hybridize and produce fertile offspring.	經最終證明，普氏野馬 (Przewalski's horse) 不是家馬的祖先，儘管可以雜交並繁殖生下有生殖力的後代。
The split between Przewalskii's horse and E. ferus caballus is estimated to have occurred 120,000– 240,000 years ago, long before domestication.	經估計，普氐野馬與歐洲野馬 (E. ferus caballus) 之間的分裂發生在 120,000– 240,000 年前，遠在馴化之前。
Of the caballine equines of E. ferus, E. f. ferus, also known as the European wild horse or "tarpan", shares ancestry with the modern domestic horse.	在歐洲野馬亞種之中，泰班野馬 (E. f. ferus；tarpan) 與現代家馬有共同祖先。
In addition, tarpans that lived into modern times may have been hybridized with domestic horses.	此外，現代的泰班野馬可能已經與家馬雜交。
In the early 20th century, "Nkosi Sikielel' iAfrika" was becoming popular with black Africans.	在20世紀初，《Nkosi Sikielel' iAfrika》越來越受非洲黑人歡迎。
In Southern Rhodesia it was originally sung in the original Xhosa language before being translated into Shona which created "Ishe Komborera Africa".	在南羅德西亞 (Southern Rhodesia)，這首歌最初是用原始的科薩語演唱，然後被翻譯成紹納語，創作了《Ishe Komborera Africa》。
The new Shona language hymn was first performed at the start of a meeting of the Southern Rhodesia Native Association and then again four days later at the closure of the first meeting of the Bantu National Congress, which the Southern Rhodesia Native Association later became affiliated to.	新的紹納語讚美詩首先在南羅德西亞原住民協會 (Southern Rhodesia Native Association) 的一次會議開始時表演唱，然後在四天後班圖人全國大會 (Bantu National Congress) 第一次會議結束時再次演唱，南羅德西亞原住民協會 (Southern Rhodesia Native Association) 後來成為該協會的附屬機構。
By the 1948 African General Strike, it had become the main political song amongst black Africans.	在 1948 年非洲總罷工時，這首歌已成為非洲黑人的主要政治歌曲。
Despite that connotation, the song was accepted by black and white Rhodesians.	儘管有這種內涵意義，這首歌還是被羅得西亞黑人和白人所接受。

Following Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the British Empire, the new Rhodesian authorities started to crack down on African liberation movements.	在羅得西亞 (Rhodesia) 單方面宣佈脫離大英帝國獨立後，羅得西亞的新當局開始鎮壓非洲解放運動。
One of their considerations was to ban performance of "Ishe Komborera Africa" in African schools and public performance of it often made people liable for arrest by the British South African Police.	新當局的其中項考慮是禁止在非洲學校表演《Ishe Komborera Africa》，而從事公開表演的人往往使會人們被英國南非警方逮捕。
The District Commissioner for Gutu abolished the Gutu African Council after its leader opened a meeting by singing "Ishe Komborera Africa" in the District Commissioner's presence.	古圖地區專員 (District Commissioner for Gutu) 因古圖非洲理事會 (Gutu African Council) 的領導人在會議開始時在地區專員面前唱《Ishe Komborera Africa》，而使古圖非洲理事會遭廢除。

Following the Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980, after Zimbabwe Rhodesia returned to British control as Southern Rhodesia, Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union party won to become the first government of an independent Zimbabwe.	1980年南羅得西亞大選後，辛巴威羅德西亞 (Zimbabwe Rhodesia) 作為南羅得西亞回歸英國控制後，Robert Mugabe 的辛巴威非洲民族聯盟黨 (Zimbabwe African National Union) 獲勝，成為辛巴威獨立後的第一個政府。
After this, "Ishe Komborera Africa" was selected to replace the official "God Save the Queen" of Southern Rhodesia and the unofficial "Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia" of Rhodesia as the national anthem of an independent Zimbabwe as it was a symbol of black African struggles and solidarity against apartheid systems in South Africa and Namibia.	在此之後，「Ishe Komborera Africa」成為非洲黑人鬥爭和團結反對南非和納米比亞種族隔離制度的象徵，而被選為獨立的辛巴威的國歌，取代南羅得西亞的官方《God Save the Queen》和羅得西亞的非官方《Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia》。
At the Zimbabwean independence ceremony, the Union Jack was lowered to "God Save the Queen" and the new flag of Zimbabwe was raised to "Ishe Komborera Africa" in Salisbury.	在辛巴威獨立儀式上，英國國旗 (Union Jack) 被降為「天佑女王」(God Save the Queen)，辛巴威的新國旗在索爾茲伯里市 (Salisbury) 被提升為《Ishe Komborera Africa》。
In 1994, it was deemed that Zimbabwe should change its national anthem to avoid similarities with other countries who used the tune of "Ishe Kombererra Africa".	1994年，人們認為辛巴威應該改變國歌，以避免與使用《Ishe Kombererra Africa》曲調的其他國家相似。
Tanzania used "Mungu ibariki Afrika", Zambia used "Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free" (to the same tune) and Transkei who used "Nkosi Sikielel' 'Afrika".	坦尚尼亞 (Tanzania) 使用「Mungu ibariki Afrika」，尚比亞 (Zambia) 使用《Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free》(以相同的曲調)，特蘭斯凱 (Transkei) 使用《Nkosi Sikielel' 'Afrika》。
It was also because Mugabe wanted to develop a new distinctly Zimbabwean identity with a unique national anthem.	這也是因為 Mugabe 想用獨特的國歌來發展一種新的獨特的辛巴威身份。
A contest was held to determine a new national anthem and "Simudzai Mureza wedu weZimbabwe" by Solomon Mutswairo was chosen.	為了確定新的國歌，舉行了一場競賽，Solomon Mutswairo 的《Simudzai Mureza wedu weZimbabwe》被選中。
The new anthem was promoted prior to "Ishe Komborera Africa" being replaced as the official national anthem.	新國歌是在《Ishe Komborera Africa》被取代為官方國歌之前就已廣為流傳。
However, there was scepticism from Christians about the need for replacing "Ishe Komborera Africa" with the belief that it was part of a plan by ZANU-PF to remove references to God from Zimbabwe's official proceedings.	然而，基督徒對是否需要取代《Ishe Komborera Africa》持懷疑態度，認為這是 ZANU-PF 從辛巴威的官方程序中刪除提及上帝所規劃的一環。
The change of anthem from "Ishe Komberera Africa" was later confirmed by the Parliament of Zimbabwe in 1995 by the passage of the National Anthem of Zimbabwe Act 10:15.	後來在1995年由辛巴威議會通過辛巴威國歌法10:15確認從「Ishe Komborera Africa」更換國歌。

Billboard 的 Andrew Hampp 回應 Unterberger 的觀點，他說：「對 Cam 回歸的懷舊情緒勝過了這首歌的整體朗朗上口。《XXL》雜誌指出，「雖然[專輯中的]許多早期歌曲缺乏真正的內容，但唱片仍然普遍令人興奮 - 與 Rick Ross 和 Cam'ron 一起的《I Am Your Leader》，與 2 Chainz 合作的《Beez In The Trap》，以及 Nas、Drake 和 Young Jeezy 的勝利《Champion》都是令人難忘的時刻」。

This referred to the rise of robots (such as combat drones) in the real world and the quote from this episode:	記者 Raju Mudhar 也寫道，在這一集中，「辛普森一家簡明扼要地闡述了我們最終的未來」。這指的是機器人（如戰鬥無人機）在現實世界中的興起以及本集的引用：
"The wars of the future will not be fought on the battlefield or at sea.	「未來的戰爭不會在戰場上或海上進行。
They will be fought in space, or possibly on top of a very tall mountain.	他們將在太空中戰鬥，或者可能在一座非常高的山頂上進行戰鬥。
In either case, most of the actual fighting will be done by small robots.	無論哪種情況，大多數實際戰鬥都將由小型機器人完成。
And as you go forth today remember always your duty is clear: To build and maintain those robots."	當你今天走出去時，永遠記住你的職責是明確的：建造和維護這些機器人。」
The episode was one of four in 1999 released on a VHS (Re-released on DVD in 2005) called Bart Wars focused on crosses between The Simpsons and Star Wars.	這一集是 1999 年在VHS上發行的四集之一（2005 年在 DVD 上重新發行），名為《星球大戰》(Bart Wars)，專注於辛普森一家和星球大戰之間的交錯。
However, one critic wrote that with this episode and "Marge Be Not Proud" and "Dog of Death," both of which are also on the DVD, the "Star Wars connection" is "tangential at best."	然而，一位評論家寫道，這一集和《瑪姬不驕傲》(Marge Be Not Proud)和《死亡之犬》(Dog of Death) 也在 DVD 上，「星球大戰的聯繫」充其量是「無關緊要的」。
By end of the 16th century Cassel had become a border town between France and the Spanish Netherlands.	到 16 世紀末，Cassel 已成為法國和西班牙荷蘭之間的邊境城鎮。
The French repeatedly fought with Spain and later the independent Dutch Republic for control of the town; in March 1645, Gaston, Duke of Orléans seized it but lost it again to the Spanish a few months later.	法國人多次與西班牙和後來獨立的荷蘭共和國爭奪該鎮的控制權。1645 年 3 月，奧爾良公爵加斯東 (Gaston, Duke of Orléans) 奪取了它，但幾個月後再次將其輸給了西班牙人。
In 1658 Turenne expelled two Irish regiments in the pay of the Spanish who were garrisoning Cassel.	1658 年，Turenne 驅逐了兩個愛爾蘭軍團，以支付駐守 Cassel 的西班牙人的薪水。
The French captured the town in July 1676 under Louis de Crevant, Duke of Humières and strengthened the castle.	1676 年 7 月，法國人在休米埃爾公爵路易·德·克雷萬特 (Louis de Crevant, Duke of Humières) 的領導下佔領了該鎮，並加固了城堡。
The following year, a third Battle of Cassel took place just west of the town on 11 April 1677 when a French army under François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg and Philippe I of Orléans defeated Dutch forces commanded by William III of Orange.	次年，第三次 Cassel 戰役於 1677 年 4 月 11 日在該鎮以西發生，當時弗朗索瓦·亨利·德·蒙莫朗西，盧森堡公爵 (François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg) 和奧爾良公爵菲利普一世 (Philippe I of Orléans) 領導的法國軍隊擊敗了奧蘭治親王威廉三世 (William III of England) 指揮的荷蘭軍隊。
The battle took place after King Louis XIV of France besieged the Dutch-held town of Saint-Omer during the Franco–Dutch War.	這場戰役發生在法國國王路易十四在法荷戰爭期間圍攻荷蘭控制的聖奧梅爾鎮 (Saint-Omer) 之後。
William sent an army to relieve Saint-Omer but was defeated at the village of Zuytpeene just to the west of Cassel, losing 7-8,000 men killed or wounded and another 4,000 taken prisoner.	威廉派出一支軍隊去解救聖奧梅爾鎮 (Saint-Omer)，但在 Cassel 以西的 Zuytpeene 村被擊敗，損失了 7,000-8,000 人死亡或受傷，另有 4,000 人被俘。
Saint-Omer fell a week later.	一週後，聖奧梅爾鎮 (Saint-Omer) 被攻陷。
Cassel was annexed to France the following year under the terms of the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war.	次年，Cassel 根據《奈梅亨條約》(Treaty of Nijmegen) 的條款被併入法國，結束了戰爭。
The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills.	吞併導致該鎮的防禦工事被拆除；這被認為是無法防衛的，因為該鎮在附近的 Mont des Récollets 的輕鬆射擊範圍內，而且加固兩座山丘的成本太高。
In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without the proximity of the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.	此外，根據條約修訂的邊界現在距離 Cassel 很遠，沒有邊界的接近，該鎮不再被視為具有太大的戰略意義。
During the French Revolutionary Wars, Cassel is said to have been the hill up which the Grand Old Duke of York marched his 10,000 men before he "marched them down again".	在法國大革命戰爭期間，據說 Cassel 是大老約克公爵 (Grand Old Duke of York) 在「再次將他們趕下」之前他的10,000名士兵行進的山丘。
While it is true that Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, did command an army in the Flanders Campaign of 1793 and was probably in the vicinity, the link with Cassel is considered dubious as the eponymous nursery rhyme appears to have originated well before the Revolutionary Wars.	雖然腓特烈王子 (Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany) 確實在 1793 年的佛蘭德斯戰役 (Flanders Campaign) 中指揮過一支軍隊，並且可能就在附近，但與 Cassel 的聯繫被認為是可疑的，因為同名的童謠似乎起源於獨立戰爭之前。
The population of Cassel grew to about 4,200 people by the mid-19th century.	到 19 世紀中葉，Cassel 的人口成長到約4 ,200 人。
Benjamin Disraeli, later to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, stayed there for a month in September–October 1845 and wrote in a letter to his sister Sarah that he considered it "an extremely savage place; few of the inhabitants, & none of the humbler classes, talk French, there is no library, bookseller's shop, nor newspaper of any sort ...	班傑明·迪斯雷利 (Benjamin Disraeli) 後來成為英國首相，於 1845 年 9 月至 10 月在那裡停留了一個月，並在給妹妹莎拉的一封信中寫道，他認為這是「一個極其野蠻的地方；少數居民，和沒有一個謙遜的階層、講法語、沒有圖書館、書店、也沒有任何形式的報紙......
It is quite French Flanders, their provisions come from Holland, the Hotel de Ville was built by the Spaniards, the carillons are perpetually sounding, & religion is supreme."	這是相當法國法蘭德斯地區 (French Flanders)，他們的食物來自荷蘭，市政廳是由西班牙人建造，鍾琴永遠悠揚，且宗教至高無上。
In 1848, Cassel gained a railway connection when the Lille-Dunkirk line was built.	1848 年，Cassel 在里爾-敦克爾克線 (Lille-Dunkirk) 建成時獲得了鐵路連接。
The station is, however, at the foot of the hill at Oxelaëre some 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) from the centre of Cassel.	然而，該車站位於 Oxelaëre 山腳下，距離 Cassel 市中心約3公里（1.9英里）。
To link the two places, an electric tramway was built under the auspices of the Compagnie des Tramways de Cassel, which operated between 1900 and 1934. It was replaced by a bus link which still operates today.	為了連接這兩個地方，在1900年至1934年間運營的 Compagnie des Tramways de Cassel 的贊助下建造了一條電動有軌電車，它被今天仍在運營的公車線路所取代。
Cassel served as the headquarters of Marshal Ferdinand Foch during the early part of the First World War, between October 1914 and May 1915.	Cassel 在第一次世界大戰初期（1914 年 10 月至 1915 年 5 月）擔任馬歇爾‧斐迪南‧佛區 (Marshal Ferdinand Foch) 指揮官。
Kruščica belonged to a group of concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia where mass executions of inmates were performed.	Kruščica 屬於克羅埃西亞獨立國 (Independent State of Croatia) 的一群集中營，在那裡大規模處決囚犯。
During first two months of the functioning of the camp, local residents killed three thousand people within it.	在集中營運作的前兩個月，當地居民殺死了其中的三千人。
At the end of July 1941, the Ustaše, under the command of Boško Cvjenćek, captured and transported a group of 74 Serbs from Pale to the Kruščica camp with the false explanation that they were going to work and earn money.	1941 年 7 月底，烏斯塔沙人 (Ustaše) 在 Boško Cvjenćek 的指揮下，俘虜了一群 74 名塞爾維亞人 (Serbs)，並將其從帕萊 (Pale) 運送到克鲁斯奇卡 (Kruščica) 集中營，並謊稱他們要工作和賺錢。
All of them were killed.	他們都被殺了。
All of them were cruelly massacred by Ustaše during the night on 5 August 1941.	在 1941 年 8 月 5 日的夜間，他們所有人都被烏斯塔沙人殘忍地屠殺。
According to a 2001 work published by Hrvatski informativni centar and authored by Topalović, imprisoned Serbs were actually political prisoners who attacked the Ustaše, attempting to kill them, refusing all calls for surrender, so the Ustaše were forced to kill them.	根據 Hrvatski informativni centar 於 2001 年出版並由 Topalović 著作的一部作品，被監禁的塞爾維亞人實際上是政治犯，他們襲擊且試圖殺死烏斯塔沙人，並且拒絕了所有投降的呼籲，因此烏斯塔沙人被迫殺死他們。
Topalović also emphasized that the Ustaše commander of the camp, Josip Tehler was killed attempting to suppress the rebellion.	Topalović 還強調，集中營的烏斯塔沙指揮官 Josip Tehler 在試圖鎮壓叛亂時被殺。
The first transport of inmates arrived at Kruščica between 28 August and 1 September 1941, when around 1,000 people, mostly Jewish women and children, were transported from concentration camps on Pag and in Gospić.	1941 年 8 月 28 日至 9 月 1 日之間第一批囚犯抵達克鲁斯奇卡，當時約有 1,000 人（其中大多數是猶太婦女和兒童）從帕格 (Pag) 和戈斯皮奇 (Gospić) 的集中營被運走。
During the night of 3 September 1941, members of the Ustaše broke into the houses of Jewish residents of Sarajevo, captured the inhabitants, and transported them to Kruščica.	1941 年 9 月 3 日夜間，烏斯塔沙成員闖入塞拉耶佛 (Sarajevo) 猶太居民的房屋，俘虜了居民，並將他們運送到克鲁斯奇卡。
The next day, the Ustaše plundered the homes of imprisoned Jewish victims.	第二天，烏斯塔沙人掠奪了被監禁的猶太受害者的家園。
At the beginning of September 1941, there were approximately 3,000 people interned in Kruščica camp, including 300 Serb women and children, with the remainder being Jews.	1941 年 9 月初，大約有 3,000 人被關押在克魯什奇察集中營，其中包括 300 名塞爾維亞婦女和兒童，其餘是猶太人。
All were housed in two buildings, 80 people to each room, without basic living conditions.	所有人都住在兩棟樓中，每個房間 80 人，沒有基本的生活條件。
The Jewish community from Zagreb sent carloads of packages to inmates in Kruščica.	來自薩格勒布 (Zagreb) 的猶太社區寄送了一車包裹給克鲁斯奇卡的囚犯。
Local Ustaše burned these before the eyes of hungry children and women, who were unable to retrieve anything.	當地的烏斯塔沙人在饑餓的兒童和婦女眼前燒毀了這些，他們無法取回任何東西。
It was difficult to accommodate and feed the inmates of this camp, so the Ustaše decided to resolve this difficulty by torturing inmates with forced labour and hunger and by killing them.	這個集中營的囚犯很難容納和餵養他們，所以烏斯塔沙人決定以強迫勞動和饑餓方式折磨囚犯並殺死他們來解決此困難。
The camp was destroyed after the Second World War.	該集中營在第二次世界大戰後被摧毀。
One building was restored, and a memorial area, occupying around 2,000 m² was established, consisting of the restored building (containing a museum), a monument created by Fadil Bilić, incorporating a text from Ivan Goran Kovačić's poem Jama, and several memorial plaques commemorating communities interned in the camp (including those from Zenica and Pale).	一座建築被修復，並建立了一個佔地約 2,000 平方公尺的紀念區，這包括經過修復的建築（包含博物館），由 Fadil Bilić 設立的紀念碑，融合了 Ivan Goran Kovačić's 的詩歌 Jama 的本文，以及幾塊紀念集中營中被拘留的社區（包括 Zenica 和 Pale 的紀念碑）。
This memorial area became known as the 'Black House' (Crna kuća).	這個紀念區被稱為「黑屋」 (Crna kuća)。
During the War in Bosnia & Herzegovina, the museum's contents were removed.	在波士尼亞與赫塞哥維納 (Bosnia & Herzegovina) 戰爭期間，博物館的內容被去除了。
In 2014, the site was declared a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.	2014 年，該遺址被宣佈為波士尼亞與赫塞哥維納國家紀念碑。
Originally, Silberling envisioned employing novice actors in the lead roles, but acknowledged performers with the level of recognition of Cage and Meg Ryan would attract support for the production.	布萊德 (Silberling) 原先想僱用新秀演員擔任主角，但明白演技深受肯定的凱吉 (Cage) 和梅格·萊恩 (Meg Ryan) 對於製片將成為具吸引力的支持。
After having completed action-oriented roles in The Rock, Con Air and Face/Off, Cage was eager to star in a more profound film when he received Stevens' screenplay.	凱奇在演出《絕地任務》(The Rock)、《空中監獄》(Con Air) 和《變臉》(Face/Off) 等動作片角色後，在接到史蒂文斯 (Stevens) 的劇本後，渴望出演一部更深刻的電影。

Andre Braugher, an actor on the television series Homicide: Life on the Street, was able to work on the project while Homicide was on break before the beginning of its sixth season.	電視劇《情理法的春天》（Homicide: Life on the Street）的演員安德魯·布瑞格 (Andre Braugher) 在《情理法的春天》第六季開始前的休息時間期間，他能夠參與這部電影。
His new co-star Dennis Franz was also starring on a police procedural series, NYPD Blue.	他的新聯合主演丹尼斯·法蘭茲 (Dennis Franz) 還出演了一部警察程序系列劇《紐約重案組》(NYPD Blue)。
Cage said that with this role, he had to switch from his regular methods of constant movements to trying to be "effective" while often still.	凱奇說，由於演出這個角色，他必須從保持定期經常運動轉變為試圖「有效率」的運動。
He remarked on having to adopt the mindset of a child, and act impressed by commonplace experiences such as feeling rain or sunlight.	他評論說，必須懷有赤子之心，並對感受雨水或陽光等司空見慣的體驗有印象深刻。
A rig for the camera was built for the scene where the angelic Seth sees Maggie look in the mirror, and the crew shot the mirror without the actors for one take so Cage's reflection could be edited out from the take with both.	為天使般的賽斯看到瑪姬照鏡子的場景建造了一個攝影機裝備，工作人員在沒有演員的情況下拍攝了鏡子，使得可以從拍攝中編輯出凱奇的反射。
Other special effects involved a "going to the light" afterlife depiction, in which Seth walks with a little girl, played by Sarah Dampf, who has died.	其他特效涉及「走向光明」的來世描繪，其中賽斯與一個小女孩一起走路，這名小女孩由已經去世的莎拉·丹普夫 (Sarah Dampf) 飾演。
After cinematographer John Seale shot the scene in a hallway, Sony Pictures Imageworks' John Nelson increased the brightness to end in white, adding splinters of light.	在攝影師約翰·西爾 (John Seale) 在走廊里拍攝了這個場景後，索尼圖形影象動作公司 (Sony Pictures Imageworks) 的約翰•尼爾森 (John Nelson) 將亮度加到白色，增添光的碎片。
Some of the film was shot at Lake Tahoe's surrounding areas and Kern County.	這部電影的部分內容是在太浩湖 (Lake Tahoe) 的周邊地區和克恩郡 (Kern County) 拍攝。

For angel scenes shot at Malibu Beach, though the characters are not physical beings, it was decided that the angels would have briefly visible footprints to avoid the perception that the sand was too hard to leave imprints.	對於在馬里布海灘 (Malibu Beach) 拍攝的天使場景，雖然角色不是有形存在體，但決定天使會有短暫的可見腳印，以避免人們認為沙子太難留下印記。
Thus, Nelson erased the footprints soon after they are first seen.	因此，尼爾森 (Nelson) 在第一次看到腳印後不久就把它們抹去了。
The score was composed by Gabriel Yared, often using three notes to convey ascent.	電影配樂由蓋布瑞·雅德 (Gabriel Yared) 作曲，通常使用三個音符來傳達上天堂。
Pop synthesizers, pianos and strings were used for the three-note compositions where the angels observe Los Angeles, where the child in the prologue dies and where Seth experiences Maggie's despair, respectively.	在天使觀察洛杉磯、序幕中的孩子死亡和賽斯分別經歷瑪姬的絕望等三段場景中使用流行合成器、鋼琴及弦樂作為配樂。

With the entry of Japan into the war, Fairley flew to Java in January 1942.	隨著日本參戰，費爾利 (Fairley) 於 1942 年 1 月飛往爪哇 (Java)。
Fairley was well aware that Java produced 90% of the world's supply of quinine and that the implications would be serious if Java was lost.	費爾利很清楚，爪哇生產世界上 90% 的奎寧供應，如果爪哇淪陷，影響將極嚴重。
He arranged for the purchase of all available stocks of quinine, some 120 long tons (120 t).	他安排購買所有可用的奎寧庫存，約 120 長噸 (120 t)。
Fairley was informed that the quinine had been loaded on board two ships.	費爾利被告知奎寧已被裝載在兩艘船上。
One was never seen again.	其中一艘船再也沒見過。
The other, the SS Klang, reached Fremantle in March.	另一艘船是黨衛軍巴生號 (SS Klang)，於三月抵達弗里曼特爾 (Fremantle)。
Although 20 long tons (20 t) of quinine was loaded on board, it was apparently unloaded when the ship stopped at Tjilatjap, possibly due to fifth columnists.	雖然船上裝載了 20 長噸 (20 t) 奎寧，但當船停在 Tjilatjap 時，顯然被卸貨了，嫌疑人可能是第五縱隊成員。
Thus, none of the shipment reached Australia.	因此，沒有一批奎寧到達澳大利亞。
Fairley himself departed Java with the I Corps staff on the transport Orcades on 21 February 1942 shortly before Java fell.	費爾利本人於 1942 年 2 月 21 日與第一軍團參謀人員在爪哇淪陷前不久乘坐運輸隊一起離開爪哇。
In General Sir Thomas Blamey's reorganisation of the Australian Army in April 1942, Fairley was appointed director of medicine at Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Melbourne.	1942 年 4 月，托馬斯·布萊梅 (Thomas Blamey) 爵士對澳大利亞陸軍進行了重組，費爾利被任命為墨爾本盟軍陸軍總部 (LHQ) 醫學主任。
Fairley was soon facing a series of medical emergencies caused by the Kokoda Track campaign.	費爾利很快就面臨由科科達小徑戰役 (Kokoda Track campaign) 引起的一系列醫療緊急情況。
An epidemic of bacillary dysentery was headed off by Fairley's decision to rush all available supplies of sulphaguanadine to New Guinea.	由於費爾利決定將所有可用的磺胍定 (sulphaguanadine) 供應緊急運往新幾內亞，阻止了桿菌性痢疾的流行。
On Fairley's advice every man who complained of diarrhoea was given the drug and the epidemic was brought under control in ten days.	由於費爾利決定將所有可用的磺胍定 (sulphaguanadine) 供應緊急運往新幾內亞，阻止了桿菌性痢疾的流行。
But Fairley's main concern was malaria.	但費爾利主要關心的是瘧疾。
Despite the experience with malaria in the Middle East, most of the troops had a poor understanding of anti-malaria precautions and few medical officers had encountered the disease.	儘管大多數部隊在中東有瘧疾方面的經驗，但對抗瘧疾預防措施知之甚少，很少有醫務人員遇到過這種疾病。
In combination with critical shortages of drugs and anti-malarial supplies such as netting, insecticides and repellents, the result was a medical disaster.	再加上蚊帳、殺蟲劑和驅蟲劑等藥物和抗瘧疾用品嚴重短缺，結果是一場醫療災難。
In the 13-week period from 31 October 1942 to 1 January 1943, the Army reported 4,137 battle casualties, but 14,011 casualties from tropical diseases, of which 12,240 were from malaria.	在 1942 年 10 月 31 日至 1943 年 1 月 1 日的 13 週內，陸軍報告 4,137 名戰鬥傷亡，但 14,011 人死於熱帶疾病，其中 12,240人 死於瘧疾。
The government grimly contemplated disbanding divisions to replace malaria casualties.	政府嚴厲考慮解散各部門以取代瘧疾傷亡。
"Our worst enemy in New Guinea," General Blamey declared, "is not the Nip—it’s the bite."	布萊梅將軍宣稱，「我們在新幾內亞最大的敵人，不是日本人，而是咬人。」
This caused Blamey to despatch a medical mission headed by Fairley to the United States and the United Kingdom in September 1942 to present the Army's case for a more adequate and equitable share of anti-malarial supplies.	這導致布萊梅於 1942 年 9 月派遣了一支由費爾利率領的醫療團前往美國和英國，向陸軍提出更充分、更公平地分配抗瘧疾物資的理由。
Illinois farmer David Johnson built his 31-foot-tall (9.4 m) goat tower in Shelby County, near Findlay, after seeing an article on Fairview in the magazine Decanter.	伊利諾伊州 (Illinois) 農民 David Johnson 在芬德利 (Findlay) 附近的謝爾比郡 (Shelby County) 建造了他的31英尺高 (9.4米) 的山羊塔，他在《品醇客》(Decanter) 雜誌上看到了一篇關於 Fairview 的文章。

In a Waunakee, Wisconsin goat petting zoo, a goat tower was built by the Endres family.	在威斯康星州 Waunakee 的山羊寵物動物園，Endres 家族建造了一座山羊塔。
The tower was designed in a Bavarian style to match other buildings of the area.	為了匹配該地區的其他建築，該塔的設計採用巴伐利亞風格。
The owners claim it is the fifth goat tower ever constructed after the ones in Fairview, the “Tower of Baaa” in Findlay, Memphis, and Ekeby.	業主聲稱這是繼 Fairview、Findlay、Memphis 和 Ekeby 的「Tower of Baaa」之後建造的第五座山羊塔。
Life at the Bottom has received mostly positive reviews.	《底層生活》(Life at the Bottom) 獲得了大多推崇的評價。
Gregory Schneider of the Topeka Capital-Journal called the collection "the best exploration of the problems of poverty ever written." America magazine writer, Peter Heinegg, considered the essays to be a "barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life...stories", but he said that Dalrymple puts too much of his personal "snorting indignation" into the text without letting the reader draw their own conclusions.	《托彼卡首府日報》(Topeka Capital-Journal) 的 Gregory Schneider 稱該集是「有史以來對貧困問題的最佳探索」。美國雜誌作家 Peter Heinegg 認為這些文章是「令人歎為觀止的可怕真實生活的彈幕......故事」，但他說，Dalrymple 將太多他個人的「嗤之以鼻的憤慨」放入內文中，而沒有讓讀者得出自己的結論。
He ended by saying, "Dalrymple's case sounds like a paranoid tirade or perverse tribute, but it is at least partially redeemed by the barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life (one assumes) stories that this very angry doctor tells...to bolster it." John Clark of Liberty magazine called it "so compelling...that I read it cover to cover in a day's time—and later reread it twice."	他最後說：「Dalrymple的案件聽起來像是偏執狂的長篇大論或反常的致敬，但它至少部分地被這個非常憤怒的醫生講述的令人歎為觀止的可怕的真實生活 (人們假設) 故事所救贖......以加強它。」《自由》(Liberty) 雜誌的 John Clark 稱其為「如此引人注目......我在一天的時間內一遍又一遍地讀了它-後來又重讀了兩遍。」
Thomas Sowell, a pundit and social critic, described it as "brilliant and insightful" in Capitalism magazine and "an insightful and devastating eyewitness account of the white underclass in Britain" in the Jewish World Review.	權威人士和社會評論家 Thomas Sowell 在《資本主義》(Capitalism) 雜誌上將其描述為「輝煌而富有洞察力」，並在《猶太世界評論》 (Jewish World Review) 上稱其為「對英國白人下層階層階級的深刻而毀滅性的目擊者描述」。
Overall, Sowell said that the collection was able to explain that "One of the most telling examples of the social destructiveness of the left's welfare-state vision can be found among the white slum dwellers in Britain." Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer, Theresa K. Weaver, called the collection "saddening, infuriating, and ultimately not terribly empowering", stating that she wishes Dalrymple "might at least offer a few ideas on turning everything around." Arthur Foulkes of the Carolina Journal described it as a "fine book" that "offers much to friends of liberty everywhere." Roger Donway of The Atlas Society considered it to be "one of the most instructive books that I have read in many years".	整體而言，Sowell 說，這些作品集能夠解釋「左翼福利國家願景的社會破壞性的最明顯的例子之一可以在英國的白人貧民窟居民中找到。」《亞特蘭大憲法報》(Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 的作者 Theresa K. Weaver 稱該系列「令人悲傷，令人憤怒，最終並不是非常強大」，並表示她希望Dalrymple「至少可以提供一些關於扭轉一切的想法」。《卡羅來納日報》(Carolina Journal) 的 Arthur Foulkes 將其描述為一本「好書」，「為世界各地的自由朋友提供了很多意涵」。《阿特拉斯協會》(The Atlas Society) 的 Roger Donway 認為它是「我多年來讀過的最具啟發性的書之一」。
Stephen Goode, writing for Insight on the News, said that the collection argued its "position brilliantly and with impressive passion".	Stephen Goode 為《新聞透視》(Insight on the News) 撰稿稱，該系列「出色地、以令人印象深刻的熱情論證了自己的地位」。
The National Observer wrote that it "has much value", if it is taken as an "antidote to fashionable loose thinking".	《國家觀察員》(National Observer) 寫道，如果該系列被視為「時髦鬆散思維的解毒劑」，就「具有很大價值」。

He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college commencement he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece.	他在佈道中受到讚揚，在哈佛大學的畢業典禮上，他被比作 Jason 拿金羊毛。
Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual.	Andros 和 Randolph 見到他並不那麼高興，似乎這種感覺是相互的。
Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph.	幾乎整個新英格蘭都團結一致反對 Andros 和 Randolph。
Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in 1683-4, does not seem to have carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.	Phip 儘管在 1683-1684 年擔任 Randolph 砲艦機的機長，但在麻薩諸塞灣 (Massachusetts Bay) 人民的心目中似乎對 Randolph 沒有印象。
Andros swore Phips into his new post in early July, but his council refused Phips' demand that the previously named sheriffs be dismissed.	Andros 使 Phips 在七月初宣誓就職，但 Phips 解僱先前任命的治安官的要求遭議會拒絕。
If Phips had simply wanted a share in the spoils of the Dominion, he might have stuck around and kept his head down.	如果 Phips 只是想分享自治領地的戰利品，他可能會留下來且保持低調。

Later that year, she collaborated with Diwekar for the third time on The Indian Food Wisdom and The Art of Eating Right, a documentary film about nutrition.	在 Mint 發表的一篇評論中，Shefalee Vasudev 批評這種寫作風格「太輕快」，但進一步表示這是「一本製作精良的書，再現了嘰嘰喳喳的小便利貼和飲食圖表，穿插著 Bebo 從她的私人專輯到時尚雜誌封面的驚人照片。」同年晚些時候，她第三次與Diwekar合作拍攝了關於營養紀錄片的《The Indian Food Wisdom》和《The Art of Eating Right》。

There they were seized by Halach Uinik, a Maya lord. Captain Vildivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast.	這些人被馬雅貴族哈拉奇・烏以尼克捕獲。巴狄維亞船長犠牲了四個同伴才活下來，他們的肉被煮來吃。

Guerrero became completely Mayanised and served his new lord with such loyalty that he was married to one of Nachan Chan's daughters, Zazil Ha, by whom he had three children.	格雷洛完全馬雅化，忠心侍奉新主人，後來取了納坎・坎的女兒莎吉爾・哈，生了三個孩子。
The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem.	阿克拉不是耶路撒冷頭一個希臘要塞。
Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts.	資料指出有一個更早的要塞托勒密堡壘，曾經佔有一個可以監視神廟區域的地點。
Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress.	該堡壘實際所在地點雖然仍在爭議之中，但大家都同意的說法，是它位於神廟山的北側，後來該地成為安東尼亞要塞所在地。
The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt.	在進入西元前 2 世紀時，該堡壘落入安條克三世之手，而且在馬加比起義中的所有述說中都未曾提及。
Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege.	雖然各種說法都指出阿克拉是在極短時間內建成，但仍然足以抵禦長期的圍困。
These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure.	因為這些原因，再加上該堡壘也有人稱之為一個阿克拉，因此也有人說這兩者其實是同一個建築物。
Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case.	雖然馬加比一世和約瑟夫斯都把阿克拉當做新建築物，但事實可能並非如此。
Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the "impious or wicked" had "remained" rather than "dwelt" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.	猶太古史 12:253 或許會讓人以為「褻瀆者或惡人」「仍然駐守」而非「住在」該堡壘中，但也可以認為阿克拉早在起義前就已建成，只有馬其頓要塞才是新建的。
Koen Decoster proposes that Josephus wrote of "a citadel in the lower part of the city" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace.	柯恩・迪可斯特認為約瑟夫斯寫下的「在城市下方的堡壘」，對讀者來說可能像西元後第一世紀的耶路撒冷一樣熟悉，該城市正好有兩座要塞：安東尼亞要塞與希臘神殿。
As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, "a citadel in the lower city" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it.	約瑟夫斯所寫的羅馬化耶路撒冷，城區已擴及西邊的高丘上，因此「在城市下方的堡壘」指的可能是任何在泰羅邊谷東邊的地方，包括樹立在神廟北方，確實崛起並控制神廟的安東尼亞。
In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.	在他看來，這就是約瑟夫斯在撰寫阿克拉相關描述時所指的地方。
Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center.	反對北方地點說的人認為，該地點並無歷史資料佐證，而且這種說法會使阿克拉遠離耶路撒冷人口集中的地區。
Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels, it was not meant as a defence against external threat, but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role incompatible with a proposed northern location.	和之前與之後的要塞不同的是，其建造目的並非用以抵抗外敵，而是要監視市內的猶太人區；如果要塞建在北邊的話，就達不到此目的。
The available sources do indicate the Acra stood south of the temple, and because 1 Maccabees is a contemporaneous account of the Maccabean revolt, its account of the Acra (1:35–38) is considered the most reliable.	現有資籵確實指出阿克拉位在神廟南側，再加上馬加比一世是馬加比起義同時代的人，因此他對阿克拉的說法 (1:35-38）最為可信。
Josephus provides an unlikely account of the razing of a hill on which the Acra had stood, yet his description of the end of the Great Revolt (70 CE) provides additional evidence for it being located south of the Temple Mount:	約瑟夫斯有個不太可信的說法，說是鏟平了阿克拉所在的山頭；但他關於大起義 （西元 70 年）結束的說法，倒是為其位在神廟南方提供了額外的證明：
...but on the next day they set fire to the repository of the archives, to Acra, to the council-house, and to the place called Ophlas; at which time the fire proceeded as far as the palace of queen Helena, which was in the middle of Acra;	...但在隔天，有人在藏書閣、阿克拉、議事堂、歐法拉斯等地縱火；當時火勢甚至波及阿克拉中的海倫娜皇宮；
— Flavius Josephus, The Wars of the Jews 6:354	－ 弗拉維斯・約瑟夫斯，猶太戰役 6:354
As the other buildings mentioned in the account all stood to the south in the Lower City, this also places the Acra there.	在描述中，其他建物都位於下城的南方，也包括阿克拉在內。
This account attests to the persistence of the name "Acra" in this part of Jerusalem many years after Hellenistic rule ended and its citadels had been overthrown, and it can also be seen as referring not to a distinct building but rather to an entire region of the city.	這種說法證實了在猶太區的阿克拉之名，即使在希臘統治結束，其堡壘都被攻破後仍然流傳多年；另一佐證是它不只用來指稱特定建築，更是整個城區的代稱。
Indeed, several clauses in 1 Maccabees may be read as making a similar point:	確實，馬卡比一世的述說中有多個部分都持類似觀點：

The other outbuilding on the property along historic Lincoln Highway are the remnants of a once dominating windmill.	在那塊地上的另一棟建物，就在歷史悠久的林肯公路旁，是個曾經風光一時的風車遺址。
Though only the foundation remains, it gives a glimpse of how impressive the structure must have once been.	雖然現在只剩下基座，但可以想見當時的結構有多令人印象深刻。
The Glidden Barn, located to the rear and east of the home, was thought to have been added to the National Register of Historic Places when the original nomination for the house was approved in 1973. However, in the late 1990s, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency revealed that the nomination included only the house.	Glidden 的倉庫位在其住宅後方東邊處，一般都以為已在 1973 年其住宅獲選登錄為國家歷史遺跡名單中時，也一同列入；但直到 1990 年代後半，伊利諾州歷史保護局才發現，當時列入名單的只有住宅而已。
The Glidden Historical Center initiated the process of adding the barn to the Register.	Glidden 歷史中心發起申請，要將倉庫也列入名單中。

The barn was built sometime around 1871, possibly even before, and is constructed of the same soft brick that makes up the exterior of the home.	該倉庫建於 1871 年前後，可能更早一點，和住宅外牆採用相同的軟質磚塊建造。
Tradition in the Glidden family holds that the barn, like the house itself, was designed and built by prominent local carpenter Jacob Haish.	由於 Glidden 家族的習慣，其住宅和倉庫都由當地十分有名的木匠 Jacob Haish 設計建造。
The famous barn, one of DeKalb County's oldest remaining, stands a full two-stories high, measuring around 50 feet (15 m) tall, with a width of 30 feet (9 m).	這個遠近馳名的倉庫，是 DeKalb 郡最古老的古蹟之一，有整整兩層樓高，約 50 呎 (15 公尺)，寬 30 呎 (9 公尺)。
In February 2007 the Glidden Homestead and Historical Center kicked off a fundraising drive.	2007 年 2 月 Glidden 產業與歷史中心發起募款活動。

It is of the three-bay, English tradition, the west bay containing a space for a stairwell leading to a hayloft and seven stalls.	其為英國傳統三間式設計，西側間包括一個通往乾草棚和七個馬房的樓梯間。

At the nominal center is a punk band called Love and Rockets, which shares its name with the English band; the punk band complains stole the name from them (the real-life band formed in 1985 and took its name from the Hernandez's comic book).

In 2016, he played the leading role of Cosimo de' Medici, the son of the founder of the Medici Bank during the Italian Renaissance, in the Italian-British television drama series, Medici: Masters of Florence.	2016 年，他在義大利-英國電視戲劇影集《麥地奇家族：佛羅倫斯大師》中扮演主角科西莫·德·麥地奇，也就是義大利文藝復興期間麥地奇銀行的創辦人之子。
In the same year he played American pickpocket Michael Mason in the 2016 action movie Bastille Day, starring alongside Idris Elba.	同年，他在 2016 年動作片《巴士底日》飾演美籍扒手麥克·梅森，與伊卓瑞斯·艾巴連袂演出。
In 2018, Madden garnered widespread critical acclaim and wider recognition for his role as Sergeant David Budd in the BBC thriller series Bodyguard.	2018 年，麥登因為在 BBC 驚悚影集《內政保鑣》的大衛·布德中士一角，獲得廣大的高度評價且更廣為人知。
After achieving high levels of popularity in the UK, the show was released to a worldwide audience on Netflix in October 2018.	在英國獲得高人氣後，該節目在 2018 年 10 月於 Netflix 對全世界的觀眾上映。
His performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama.	他的演出使他贏得金球獎劇情類劇集最佳男主角。
Bodyguard went on to be nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series.	《內政保鑣》之後又獲得黃金時段艾美獎最佳影集提名。
Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.	裘莉在飽受戰爭摧殘的柬埔寨拍攝《古墓奇兵》(2001) 時首次目睹人道危機的影響；她之後認為這個經歷幫助她對世界有更深入的瞭解。
Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.	裘莉返家後聯絡了聯合國難民事務高級專員 (UNHCR) 以尋求有關國際不安定地區的資訊。
To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world.	為了深入瞭解這些地區的情況，她開始探訪世界各地的難民營。
In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.	2001 年 2 月，她展開了第一次實地探訪，是前往獅子山和坦尚尼亞的 18 天訪問；她之後表示對所目睹的情況感到震驚。
In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal, the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.	之後的幾個月，裘莉返回柬埔寨兩週，並在巴基斯坦與阿富汗難民會面，她在那裡捐出了 100 萬美元以響應國際 UNHCR 緊急呼籲，這是 UNHCR 歷來從私人收到的最大筆捐款。
She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.	她在所有的探訪期間負擔了與她訪問相關的所有費用，而且與 UNHCR 當地人員共享相同的基礎工作和生活條件。
Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.	裘莉在 2001 年 8 月 27 日於日內瓦的 UNHCR 總部獲任命為 UNHCR 親善大使。
Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.	在接下來的十年間，她持續進行超過 40 場實地考察，在超過 30 個國家與難民和國內流離失所者見面。
In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, "Awareness of the plight of these people.	2002 年，被問及她希望實現什麼時，她表示「讓人們意識到這些人的困境。
I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon." To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.	我認為他們應該因為從苦難中存活下來而獲得讚揚，而不是遭到鄙視。」為此，她在 2001-02 年的實地考察都編入她的《我的旅行筆記》中；該書在 2003 年 10 月與她的人道劇情片《戰火情人》聯合發行。
Jolie aimed to visit what she termed "forgotten emergencies," crises that media attention had shifted away from.	裘莉致力於探訪媒體已不再關注且被她稱為「被遺忘的緊急事件」危機。
She became noted for traveling to war zones, such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict, the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War, where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces, and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.	她因為前往戰區而變得出名，例如蘇丹在達佛衝突期間的達佛地區、伊拉克戰爭期間的敘利亞-伊拉克邊界 (她在那裡私下與美軍及其他多國軍隊碰面)，以及在阿富汗戰爭期間的阿富汗首都喀布爾 (在那裡，有三位救援工作者在她第一次探訪當中遭到殺害)。
To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world; she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.	為了替她的旅行提供助力，她在 2004 年開始參加飛行課程，目的是在世界各地運送救援工作者和食物補給；她現在持有具備儀器飛行證的私人飛行執照，且擁有一部 Cirrus SR22 和 Cessna 208 Caravan 單引擎飛機。
On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization.	在擔任 UNHCR 親善大使超過十年之後，裘莉在 2012 年 4 月 17 日獲升任為高級專員安東尼歐·古特瑞斯的特使，是第一個在該組織內獲得此類職位的人。
In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.	她的角色提升後，便獲授權在外交層級代表古特瑞斯和 UNHCR，聚焦於重大難民危機。
In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees, and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.	她在升任後的幾個月後第一次 (是整體的第三次) 以特使身分訪視厄瓜多，她在那裡與哥倫比亞難民見面，並陪同古特瑞斯進行為期一週的約旦、黎巴嫩、土耳其和伊拉克之旅，以評估來自鄰國敘利亞的難民情形。
Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.	從那時開始，裘莉在世界各地進行了十多次實地考察，與難民見面並代表他們提出倡議。
In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born adopted son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003.	為了努力使她柬埔寨裔的領養兒子與他的傳統建立連結，裘莉在 2003 年於他出生的故鄉買了一間房子。
The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species.	這間位於馬德望省西北邊的傳統住家占地 39 公頃，鄰接荳蔻山脈中的薩姆洛特國家公園；該公園曾遭到威脅瀕危物種的盜獵者潛入。
She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.	她買下了這座公園的 60,000 公頃，並將該區域轉變成以她兒子為名的野生保護區，麥道斯·裘莉專案。
Released as a single in July 1969, "Space Oddity" was a largely acoustic number augmented by the eerie tones of the composer's Stylophone, a pocket electronic organ.	1969 年 7 月以單曲發行的《太空怪談》是大量以作曲者的筆型合成器 (一種口袋電子管風琴) 怪異音調增音的歌曲。
The title and subject matter were inspired by Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and introduced the character of Major Tom.	歌名和主題的靈感來源是史丹利·庫柏力克的《2001：太空漫遊》，並介紹了湯姆少校的角色。
The song dates back as early as February 1969.	這首歌最早追溯至 1969 年 2 月。
It was written for a promotional video named "Love You till Tuesday".	它是為一部名為《愛你到週二》的宣傳影片所寫。
The video's intent was to sell Bowie to a new label as he had been dropped from Deram Records in April 1968.	這段影片的用意是向新的唱片公司推銷鮑伊，因為他在 1968 年 4 月遭到迪拉姆唱片終止合約。
He was urged by his manager Kenneth Pitt to record some new material and so "Space Oddity" was born.	他被經紀人肯尼斯·皮特催促錄製一些新的材料，《太空怪談》因而誕生。
Some commentators have also seen the song as a metaphor for heroin use, citing the opening countdown as analogous to the drug's passage down the needle prior to the euphoric 'hit', and noting Bowie's admission of a "silly flirtation with smack" in 1968.	部分評論家也將該歌曲視為使用海洛因的比喻，引用開場的倒數作為狂喜「發作」之前藥物沿著針頭而下的類比，並註記了鮑伊在 1968 年坦承「與海洛因的一場愚蠢邂逅」。
His 1980 hit "Ashes to Ashes" declared "We know Major Tom's a junkie".	他的 1980 年熱門作品《塵歸塵》宣告「我們知道湯姆少校是癮君子」。
"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed" reflected a strong Bob Dylan influence, with its harmonica, edgy guitar sound and snarling vocal.	《卑下又有點茫然》以口琴、前衛的吉他聲和咆哮的歌聲反映出強烈的巴布·狄倫影響力。
"Letter to Hermione" was a farewell ballad to Bowie's former girlfriend, Hermione Farthingale, who was also the subject of "An Occasional Dream", a gentle folk tune reminiscent of the singer's 1967 debut album.	《給赫敏的信》是向鮑伊前女友赫敏·法丁蓋爾的告別情歌；她也是《偶然的夢》的主題，該歌曲是讓人聯想到該歌手 1967 年出道專輯的溫柔民謠曲調。
"God Knows I'm Good", Bowie's observational tale of a shoplifter's plight, also recalled his earlier style.	《上帝知道我很好》是鮑伊對商店扒手處境的觀察敘述，也令人回想起他的早期風格。
"Cygnet Committee" has been called Bowie's "first true masterpiece".	《小天鵝委員會》被稱為鮑伊的「第一部真正的傑作」。
Commonly regarded as the album track most indicative of the composer's future direction, its lead character is a messianic figure "who breaks down barriers for his younger followers, but finds that he has only provided them with the means to reject and destroy him".	這首歌被普遍視為最能象徵作曲者未來方向的專輯曲目，其主角是一位彌賽亞人「為他年輕的追隨者打破隔閡，卻發現他只為他們提供了拒絕和摧毀他的工具」。
Bowie himself described it at the time as a put down of hippies who seemed ready to follow any charismatic leader.	鮑伊本人當時將它形容為，對於似乎準備好追隨任何魅力型領導者的嬉皮的貶低。
Another track cited as foreshadowing themes to which Bowie would return in the 1970s, in this case the fracturing of personality, was "Janine", which featured the words "But if you took an axe to me, you'd kill another man not me at all".	另一首被視為鮑伊將在 1970 年代回歸的伏筆主題 (在此情況下為人格的裂解) 是《珍寧》一曲，其中特別用了「但是如果你將我摧毀，你殺掉可能會是另一個男人，而不是我」字眼。
The Buddhism-influenced "Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud" was presented in a heavily expanded form compared to the original guitar-and-cello version on the B-side of the "Space Oddity" single; the album cut featured a 50-piece orchestra.	相較於《太空怪談》單曲 B 面的原始吉他和大提琴版本，受到佛教影響的《來自費克勞德的野眼男孩》則是以大量擴展的形式呈現；專輯的特輯是以 50 人管弦樂為特色。
"Memory of a Free Festival" was Bowie's reminiscence of an arts festival he had organised in August 1969.	《自由慶典的記憶》是鮑伊回想他在 1969 年 8 月舉辦過的一場藝術音樂節。
Its drawn-out fade/chorus ("The Sun Machine is coming down / And we're gonna have a party") was compared to The Beatles' "Hey Jude"; the song has also been interpreted as a derisive comment on the counterculture it was ostensibly celebrating.	它冗長的淡出/合唱 (「太陽機器即將落下 / 而我們將舉辦派對」) 被拿來和披頭四「Hey Jude」比較；該歌曲也被詮釋為對表面上讚頌的反文化做出嘲諷評論。
The background vocals for the crowd finale featured Bob Harris, his wife Sue, Tony Woollcott and Marc Bolan among other people.	大合唱終曲的背景演唱特別呈現了鮑伯·哈里斯、他的妻子蘇、東尼·沃柯特和馬克·波倫等人。
In 1970 Bowie cut the tune in half for the A- and B-sides of a more rock-oriented version featuring the band that would accompany him on The Man Who Sold the World later that year: Mick Ronson, Tony Visconti and Mick Woodmansey – an embryonic form of Ziggy Stardust's Spiders From Mars.	1970 年，鮑伊針對較為搖滾導向的版本 A 面和 B 面將曲調減半；該版本主打的是當年稍後和他在《出賣世界的男人》伴奏的樂團：米克·朗森、托尼·維斯康蒂和米克·伍德曼西。此版本是《Ziggy Stardust 來自火星的蜘蛛》的雛形。
NY 215 began at a three-way intersection with NY 360 east of the hamlet of Morton in the town of Hamlin.	NY 215 的開端是與漢姆林鎮摩頓村東邊 NY 360 交會的三向路口。
NY 360 turned off Redman Road here to follow Morton Road west to the hamlet of Morton while NY 215 headed north on Redman Road.	NY 360 在這裡轉離雷德曼路以沿著摩頓路往西至摩頓村，NY 215 則是在雷德曼路上往北前進。
It passed by open, cultivated fields and small pockets of residences as it proceeded through rural northwestern Monroe County.	它在穿越門羅郡西北郊區的途中，行經了開闊的耕田和小型零星的住宅。
After 1.5 miles (2.4 km), NY 215 intersected Moscow Road, a local highway connecting NY 215 to the then-western end of the Lake Ontario State Parkway.	1.5 英哩 (2.4 公里) 之後，NY 215 與莫斯科路交會；這是一條將 NY 215 連接到當時安大略湖州立公園大道西端的當地公路。
North of Moscow Road, the fields on the highway's east side slowly gave way to forested areas as the route approached Hamlin Beach State Park and intersected Cook Road.	莫斯科路北邊，隨著路線接近漢姆林海灘州立公園並和庫克路交會，公路西側的田野慢慢地被樹木叢生的區域取代。
The route terminated 500 feet (150 m) north of Cook Road at the southern boundary of Hamlin Beach State Park.	這條路線的終點在漢姆林海灘州立公園南方邊界的庫克路北邊 500 英呎 (150 公尺) 處。
The physical roadway continued into the park and to nearby Lake Ontario as a local highway.	實體道路繼續進入公園，並作為當地公路前往附近的安大略湖。
The portion of Redman Road north of modern NY 360 in Hamlin was a state highway as early as 1920; however, it was not assigned a designation until the early 1940s, when it became NY 215.	漢姆林現今 NY 360 北邊的雷德曼路部分，早在 1920 年時就是州立公路，但是直到 1940 年代初期才獲派稱號，也就在當時成為 NY 215。
At the time, it was the primary highway to and from Hamlin Beach State Park on the Lake Ontario shoreline, as no continuous east–west lakeside roadway existed at the time.	當時，它是往返安大略湖湖岸之漢姆林海灘州立公園的主要公路，因為那時候沒有連續的東西向湖畔道路。
This changed in the late 1940s and early 1950s following the construction of the Lake Ontario State Parkway, a lakeshore highway connecting the park to NY 261 in Greece.	這一點在 1940 年代晚期和 1950 年代早期建造安大略湖州立公園大道之後改變了；該公園大道是將公園連接至葛利斯的 NY 261 的湖岸公路。
The parkway began east of NY 215 at Moscow Road and provided a direct connection to Hamlin Beach State Park from Greece, and eventually Rochester.	公園大道始自莫斯科路的 NY 215 東邊，並從葛利斯直接銜接到漢姆林海灘州立公園，以及最後的羅徹斯特。
As a result, NY 215 became merely an alternate route to the park.	因此，NY 215 僅成了前往公園的替代路線。
In the early 1970s, the Lake Ontario State Parkway was extended westward across Monroe and Orleans counties to Lakeside Beach State Park in Carlton.	1970 年代初期，安大略湖州立公園大道往西延伸至穿越門羅和奧爾良郡，直到卡爾頓的湖畔海灘州立公園。
NY 215's connection to Hamlin Beach State Park was severed as part of the construction.	在建造的過程中，NY 215 對漢姆林海灘州立公園的連接遭到截斷。
As a result, the remaining portion of NY 215 from NY 360 to Cook Road lost its signed route status and was redesignated NY 941P, an unsigned reference route.	因此，NY 215 從 NY 360 到庫克路的剩餘部分失去了其標示路線狀態，而且重新定名為未標示的參考路線 NY 941P。
The highway remained state maintained until 2007, when ownership and maintenance of it was transferred from the state of New York to Monroe County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.	這條公路一直到 2007 年都是由州政府維護，該年它的擁有權和維修從紐約州轉移給門羅郡，作為兩個政府層級之間公路維護互換的一部分。
A bill (S4856, 2007) to enact the swap was introduced in the New York State Senate on April 23 and passed by both the Senate and the New York State Assembly on June 20.	4 月 23 日在紐約州參議院推行了一項法案 (S4856, 2007) 以頒布此互換事項，並在 6 月 20 日由參議院和紐約州眾議院雙方通過。
The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August 28. Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November 26, 2007. The former routing of NY 941P is now part of CR 236.	這個法案在 8 月 28 日由州長艾略特·史必哲簽署成為法律。根據法案的條款，它在簽署成為法律的 90 天後生效；因此，維護工作的互換在 2007 年 11 月 26 日正式實施。NY 941P 先前的路線現在是 CR 236 的一部分。
Like all species in the genus Lactarius, L. subflammeus is mycorrhizal, forming mutualistic associations with trees.	就像乳菇屬中的所有種類，橙乳菇是與樹木形成互利共生關係的菌根。
The fungus and the plant forms structures called ectomycorrhizae, a specialized sheath of hyphae on the surface of the root from which hyphae extend into the soil and into the outer cortical cells of the root.	這種真菌和植物會形成稱為外生菌根的結構，是根部表面上的特殊菌絲鞘，菌絲從其中延伸到土壤中，並進入根部的外部皮質細胞。
The fruit bodies of L. subflammeus grow scattered to grouped under conifers or in mixed conifer-hardwood forests near pine and spruce, from August to December.	8 月到 12 月間，橙乳菇的子實體會在針葉樹下方或混合針葉闊葉林中松樹及雲杉的附近，分散地生長至成群。
The fungus is widely distributed in the Pacific Northwest, where it is very common in conifer forests.	這種真菌廣泛地分布在太平洋西北地區，在其中的針葉林中非常常見。
The habitat of the type location was coastal sand dunes under pine.	這種模式的棲地地點是海岸沙丘的松樹下方。
States from which the fungus has been collected include Washington, Idaho, Oregon, California, and Colorado.	曾經採集到這種真菌的州包括華盛頓、愛達荷、奧勒岡、加州和科羅拉多。
The mushroom's range extends north into Canada, where it has been found near Victoria, British Columbia in coastal forests dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).	這種真菌的範圍延伸至加拿大，曾在卑詩省維多利亞附近主要生長花旗松 (Pseudotsuga menziesii) 的海岸森林中發現。
Brooks left St.	布魯克斯離開了聖
Ives and moved to Paris.	艾維斯並搬到巴黎。
Poor young painters such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse were creating new art in the Bohemian districts of Montparnasse and Montmartre.	像帕布羅·畢卡索和亨利·馬諦斯這類的年輕窮畫家，都在蒙帕納斯和蒙馬特的波西米亞區創作新藝術。
In contrast, Brooks took an apartment in the fashionable 16th arrondissement, mingled in elite social circles, and painted portraits of wealthy and titled women.	相反地，布魯克斯在時尚的第 16 區租下一間公寓、與上流社交圈交往，並畫出富裕且有地位的女性肖像。
These included her current lover, the Princess de Polignac.	這些肖像包括她當時的情人，波利尼亞克公主。
In 1910 Brooks had her first solo show at the prestigious Gallery Durand-Ruel, displaying thirteen paintings, almost all of women or young girls.	1910 年，布魯克斯在具聲望的杜朗魯耶畫廊舉辦第一場個展，展示了十三幅畫作，幾乎全數都是女性或年輕女孩。
Some were portraits; others showed anonymous models in interior scenes or against tonal backgrounds, often with pensive or withdrawn expressions.	有些是肖像；其他則是展示在室內場景或使用調色背景的匿名模特兒，通常帶有哀愁或孤僻的表情。
The paintings were generally naturalistic, showing an attentive eye for the details of Belle Époque fashion, with parasols, veils, and elaborate bonnets on display.	這些畫作普遍來說屬自然主義，展現了洋傘、面紗和精緻的無邊女帽，顯示出對美好年代時尚的細微觀察。
Brooks included two nude studies in this first exhibition—a provocative choice for a woman artist in 1910.	布魯克斯在這個第一場展覽中納入了兩幅裸體習作──這在 1910 年對於女性藝術家而言是相當大膽的選擇。
In The Red Jacket, a young woman stands in front of a large folding screen, wearing only a small open jacket, with her hands behind her back.	在《紅外套》中，有一位年輕女性站在大型摺疊屏風前，僅穿著一件小型開襟外套，並將雙手放在背後。
She is so frail, and her downcast face looks so forlorn that one contemporary reviewer referred to her as a consumptive; Brooks described her simply as "a poor girl who was cold".	她非常虛弱，而且垂頭喪氣的臉看起來如此悲慘，以至於一位當代評論家將她稱為肺病患者；布魯克斯僅將她形容為「感到寒冷的窮女孩」。
The other, White Azaleas, is a more sexually charged nude study of a woman reclining on a couch.	另一幅《白色杜鵑花》是一位女性斜躺在沙發上、更充滿色情意味的裸體習作。
Contemporary reviews compared it to Francisco de Goya's La maja desnuda and Édouard Manet's Olympia.	當代評論將它與法蘭西斯科·哥雅的《La maja desnuda》和愛德華·馬奈的《奧林匹亞》進行比較。
Unlike the women in those paintings, the subject of White Azaleas looks away from the viewer; in the background above her is a series of Japanese prints which Brooks loved.	與那些畫作中的女性不同的是，《白色杜鵑花》主角的視線避開了觀賞者；她上方的背景中是布魯克相當喜愛的一系列日本版畫。
The exhibition established Brooks' reputation as an artist.	該展覽確立了布魯克斯的藝術家聲望。
Reviews were effusive, and the poet Robert de Montesquiou wrote an appreciation calling her "the thief of souls." The restrained, almost monochromatic decor of her home also attracted attention; she was often asked to give advice on interior design, and sometimes did, though she did not relish the role of decorator.	評論相當熱烈，詩人羅伯特·德孟德斯鳩還寫了一篇賞析，稱她為「靈魂偷竊者」。她家中樸素到幾乎單色的裝飾也引起了注意；經常有人要求她提供室內設計的建議，而儘管她並不喜歡裝潢師的角色，有時候還是會提供。
Brooks became increasingly disillusioned with Parisian high society, finding the conversation dull, and feeling that people were whispering about her.	布魯克斯對於巴黎上層社會的幻想逐漸破滅，因為她發現對話乏味，而且覺得人們私底下都在議論她。
Despite her artistic success, she described herself as a lapidée—literally, a victim of stoning.	即使在藝術上獲得成功，她仍然形容自己為 lapidée—字面上的意思是遭石頭砸死的受害者。
In 1909 Brooks met Gabriele D'Annunzio, an Italian writer and politician who had come to France to escape his debts.	1909 年，布魯克斯遇見了加布里埃爾·達努吉歐，一位到法國躲避債務的義大利作家和政治家。
She saw him as a martyred artist, another lapidé; he wrote poems based on her works and called her "the most profound and wise orchestrator of grays in modern painting".	她將他視為具犧牲精神的藝術家，也就是另一個 lapidé；他以她的作品寫了詩，並稱她「在現代繪畫中最有深度和智慧的灰色編排者」。
Astrocytes form gap junctions and are closely associated with the vasculature and its basal lamina in the adult SVZ and subsequently in the RMS.	星狀細胞會形成裂隙接合，而且與成體 SVZ 和之後 RMS 中的血管分布及其基底層密切相關。
They may serve as an interface to modulate influences of endothelial and circulation-derived factors as well as the availability of cytokines and growth factors in this system.	它們可能有介面的作用，可調節內皮和循環衍生因子的影響，以及此系統的細胞激素可用性和成長因子。
In addition, astrocytes derived from the neurogenic hippocampus and SVZ, but not from the non-neurogenic spinal cord, promote proliferation and neuronal fate commitment of multipotent adult neural stem cells in culture, suggesting a role in the RMS.	此外，衍生自神經性海馬迴和 SVZ，而不是來自非神經性脊隨的星狀細胞，在培養中會促進多潛能成體神經幹細胞的增生和神經命運承諾，意指在 RMS 中有所作用。
Astrocytes express a number of secreted and membrane-attached factors both in vitro and in vivo that are known to regulate proliferation and fate specification of adult neural precursors as well as neuronal migration, maturation, and synapse formation.	星狀細胞在試管和活體內都表現出多個隱匿且附著在膜上的因子，而它們已知會控制成體神經前驅細胞的增生和命運特化，以及神經元移行、成熟和突觸形成。
In the adult SVZ, astrocytes express Robo receptors and regulate the rapid migration of SLIT1-expressing neuroblasts through the RMS.	在成體 SVZ 中，星狀細胞會表現 Robo 受體，並透過 RMS 來調節表現出 SLIT1 之神經母細胞的快速移行。
Additionally, it has been proposed that the neuroblasts themselves play a role in modulating the astrocytes through Slit-Robo interactions.	此外，也有人提出神經母細胞本身會透過裂隙-Robo 互動的方式，在調節星狀細胞方面發揮作用。
In the absence of Slit, astrocytic processes do not align correctly, or create the "tubes", instead running across the migrating neurons.	缺少裂隙時，星狀細胞處理就無法正確調整，或是會產生「管壁」，而不是穿過移行神經元。
Adult SVZ astrocytes also appear to release glutamate to regulate the survival of neuroblasts.	成體 SVZ 星狀細胞似乎也會釋放麩胺酸鹽來調節神經母細胞的存活。
Unique to the adult SVZ, ependymal cells lining the ventricular wall are in close association with neural precursors and their progeny, acting like a shield to protect the "neurogenic niche", a zone in which stem cells are retained after embryonic development for the production of new cells of the nervous system.	成體 SVZ 獨有的是，心室壁內襯的室管膜細胞與神經前驅細胞及其子代密切相關，有如盾牌一樣保護「神經性利基」，也就是是胚胎發育後保留幹細胞以便神經系統產生新細胞的區域。
Ependymal cells actively regulate neuronal fate specification of adult neural precursors through release of Noggin.	室管膜細胞會透過釋放 Noggin 來主動調節成體神經前驅細胞的神經元命運特化。
Beating of the cilia of ependymal cells appears to set up concentration gradients of guidance molecules, such as cytokines TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), to direct migration of neuroblasts, such as in the RMS.	室管膜細胞的纖毛拍打似乎會設定導向分子 (例如細胞激素 TNF-α (腫瘤壞死因子) 和 IGF-1 (似胰島素生長因子)) 的濃度梯度，能夠引導神經母細胞的移行，例如在 RMS 中。
Microglia also actively regulate adult neurogenesis.	神經膠質細胞也會主動調節成體神經生成。
Under basal conditions, apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from the niche by unactivated microglia in the adult SGZ.	在基本狀態下，成體 SGZ 中新產生之神經元的凋亡屍體會被未活化的小神經膠質細胞從利基快速吞噬。
Under inflammatory conditions, reactivated microglia can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of adult neurogenesis, depending on the balance between secreted molecules with pro- and anti-inflammatory action.	在發炎狀態下，視隱匿分子與促進發炎和抗發炎作用之間的平衡而定，重新活化的小神經膠質細胞可能會對成體神經生成的不同層面同時帶來有益和有害的影響。
In one study, the activation of microglia and recruitment of T cells were suggested to be required for enriched environment-induced SGZ neurogenesis, suggesting a possible role in the RMS.	在一項研究中，建議需要活化小神經膠質細胞和補充 T 細胞才能濃化環境誘發的 SGZ 神經新生，意指在 RMS 中可能有所作用。
Cells in the RMS are believed to move by "chain migration".	RMS 中的細胞被認為是透過「連鎖移行」移動。
These neuroblasts are connected by membrane specializations including gap junctions and adherens junctions, moving along each other towards the olfactory bulb through glial tubes.	這些神經母細胞是以包括裂隙接合和黏連結合等膜特化方式連結，會順著彼此透過神經膠細胞管移向嗅球。
The pathway and mechanisms behind this movement are a ventriculo-olfactory neurogenic system (VONS), a glial framework, and a chemotaxic cell signalling system.	這種移動背後的途徑和機制是腦室-嗅覺神經性系統 (VONS)、神經膠細胞架構和趨化性細胞傳信系統。
The olfactory system is made up in part of the RMS which stretches from the subventricular zone in the wall of the lateral ventricle, through the basal forebrain, to the olfactory bulb (OB).	嗅覺系統一部分是由延伸自側腦室壁之腦室下區的 RMS 所組成，穿過基底前腦直到嗅球 (OB)。
VONS is the name given to this pathway, and it consists of the subventricular zone, the RMS, the olfactory tract and the olfactory bulb.	VONS 是此途徑的命名，而且是由腦室下區、RMS、嗅神經束和嗅球所組成。
On January 21, 2007, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Nadi, Fiji identified a tropical depression, which was given the number 08F, about 435 km (270 mi) west-northwest of Savai'i island in Samoa.	2007 年 1 月 21 日，位於斐濟納迪的區域專責氣象中心發現了一個熱帶低壓，並為其提供編號 08F，大約在薩摩亞薩瓦伊島西北西 435 公里 (270 英哩) 處。
The depression slowly traveled towards the east-southeast for several days as the overall structure of the storm fluctuated due to diurnal variations and strong wind shear.	該低氣壓數天緩慢地移向東南東，同時暴風整體結構因為日變化和強烈風切而有所波動。
Around 1700 UTC on January 22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the depression.	大約 1 月 22 日 17:00 UTC 時，聯合颱風警報中心 (JTWC) 針對這個低壓發出熱帶氣旋形成警報。
The system developed a large banding feature in the northern portion of the circulation and deep convection formed around the center of circulation.	該系統在環流的北邊部分發展出大型的成帶現象，並在環流中心附近形成深對流。
The depression had moved into an area of weak to moderate wind shear with favorable diffulence aloft.	這個低氣壓曾進入一個高空具備有利分流的弱至中度風切區域。
Later that day, gale warnings were issued for the northeastern quadrant of the system.	當天稍晚針對該系統的東北象限發出了強風警報。
Tropical Depression 08F continued to develop as an anticyclone developed above the system, enhancing the environment around it.	熱帶低壓 08F 持續發展，同時系統上方發展出一個反氣旋，因此強化了它周邊的環境。
A mid-latitude trough located north of the depression was steering it towards the east.	一個位於低壓北邊的中緯度低壓槽使它往東轉向。
Early on January 24, the system became better organized and strengthened into a cyclone at 0600 UTC.	1 月 24 日一早，該系統變得結構更穩固，並在 06:00 UTC 增強成氣旋。
The storm, which was named Arthur by the RSMC Nadi, began to undergo rapid intensification as the structure improved significantly.	這個由納迪 RSMC 命名為亞瑟的風暴開始快速增強，同時結構大幅增進。
Deep convection developed around the center with strong outflow towards the north.	中心附近發展出深對流，且帶有往北的強勁外流。
Several hours after becoming a cyclone, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Cyclone 09P as it traveled quickly towards the east-southeast.	成為氣旋之後數小時，隨著熱帶氣旋 09P 快速移向東南東，JTWC 對它發出了第一個警示。
The quick movement was due to the influences of subtropical ridge to the north and a trough to the south.	這個快速移動是北邊的副熱帶脊和南邊的低壓槽影響所造成。
Later that day, a banding eye feature began to develop as the storm intensified into a Category 2 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale.	當天稍晚，暴風增強成澳洲強度等級的 2 級氣旋時，一個雲捲風眼形貌開始發展。
At 1800 UTC, the JTWC assessed Arthur to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 1-minute winds), the equivalent of a minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.	18:00 UTC 時，JTWC 評估亞瑟已達到最高強度，具備 120 km/h (1 分鐘風速 75 mph)，等於薩菲爾-辛普森颶風風力等級的 1 級颶風最低程度。
Early on January 25, Arthur reached its peak intensity with winds of 110 km/h (70 mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 975 hPa (mbar) while located about 635 km (350 mi) north-northwest of Rarotonga.	1 月 25 日一早，亞瑟位在拉羅湯加北北西約 635 公里 (350 英哩) 時，以 110 km/h 的風 (10 分鐘風速 70 mph) 和最低氣壓 975 hPa (mbar) 達到最高強度。
Shortly after peaking in intensity, Arthur began to undergo an extratropical transition and rapidly deteriorated due to strong wind shear.	在強度達到巔峰後不久，亞瑟開始經歷溫帶氣旋轉換，並因為強勁的風切而迅速劣化。
The storm also began to merge with a low-level frontal boundary associated with the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Zita.	暴風也開始與殘餘的熱帶氣旋思蒂關聯的低層前邊界合併。
The strong shear left the center of circulation partially exposed, with deep convection persisting in only the southeastern quadrant.	強勁的風切使得環流中心有一部分暴露在外，只在東南象限持續存在深對流。
In addition to the shear, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken further.	除了風切之外，乾空氣也開始進入系統，導致它進一步減弱。
The olm is a symbol of Slovenian natural heritage.	洞螈是斯洛維尼亞自然遺址的象徵。
The enthusiasm of scientists and the broader public about this inhabitant of Slovenian caves is still strong 300 years after its discovery.	在發現這種斯洛維尼亞洞穴棲息動物的 300 年後，科學家和普羅大眾對於牠的熱情仍然不減。
Postojna Cave is one of the birthplaces of speleobiology due to the olm and other rare cave inhabitants, such as the blind cave beetle.	由於波斯托伊納洞穴有洞螈和其他稀有洞穴棲息動物 (例如盲眼洞穴甲蟲)，因此是洞穴生物學的發源地之一。
The image of the olm contributes significantly to the fame of Postojna Cave, which Slovenia successfully utilizes for the promotion of ecotourism in Postojna and other parts of Slovenian karst.	洞螈的形象對波斯托伊納洞穴的名聲大有貢獻，斯洛維尼亞還成功地利用牠來推廣波斯托伊納及斯洛維尼亞其他喀斯特地形的生態旅遊。
Tours of Postojna Cave also include a tour around the speleobiological station – the Proteus vivarium, showing different aspects of the cave environment.	波斯托伊納洞穴之旅也包括在洞穴生物學站 (洞螈生態館) 周圍遊覽，該處展示了洞穴環境的不同層面。
The olm was also depicted on one of the Slovenian tolar coins, and was the namesake of Proteus, the oldest Slovenian popular science magazine, first published in 1933.	洞螈也描繪在其中一種斯洛維尼亞托拉爾硬幣上，而且與斯洛維尼亞最古老、首次出版於 1933 年的大眾科學雜誌《Proteus》同名。
Heavy rains from the storm affected the Philippines, causing flooding that forced 3,500 people to evacuate their houses.	暴風帶來的大雨影響了菲律賓，所導致的水患迫使 3,500 人撤離家園。

Fossils often become flattened during fossilization, but AMNH 5060 is preserved three-dimensionally, without significant deformation.	化石通常會在化石作用期間變得扁平，但是 AMNH 5060 以立體方式保存，而且沒有顯著的變形。
The specimen was found lying on its back, with head and neck twisted upwards, backwards, and to the right side of the body.	這個樣本被發現時為仰躺姿勢，頭部和頸部向上、向後扭轉，並朝向身體的右側。
Both knees are drawn forwards, while the forelimbs are outstretched.	雙膝都往前，前肢則是向外延伸。
Although the tail curves upwards and forwards over the body in many dinosaur skeletons, it was probably straight in the mummy as movement would have been restricted by ossified tendons.	雖然在許多恐龍的骨骼中，尾巴會在身體上方向上並向前彎曲，但可能因為鈣化的肌腱使動作受到限制，在這個木乃伊中變成直的。
Almost two-thirds of the total skin area is preserved, often with excellent preservation.	整體皮膚區域有將近三分之二保存了下來，這通常是因為使用了極佳的防腐方式。
The skin impressions are pressed tightly onto the bones, and are partially drawn into the body in between the bones.	皮膚印痕緊密地壓在骨頭上，而且有部分已陷入骨頭之間的體內。
When discovered, skin impressions probably encased the whole skeleton, but were partially destroyed while freeing it from the surrounding rocks.	發現時，皮膚印痕可能已經包住整副骨骼，但是將它與周邊岩石分離時毀損了一部分。
Skin impressions are preserved on the forelimbs, neck and throat, and the chest, as well as on the right side of the trunk.	前肢、頸部、喉部、胸口和軀幹右側上保存了皮膚印痕。
As well as the skin impressions, Sternberg noted the preservation of muscle impressions.	除了皮膚印痕以外，斯騰伯格也註記了肌肉痕跡的保存。
In 2007, paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter suggested that even impressions of inner organs are possibly preserved; this cannot be evaluated without detailed computer tomography and x-ray analyses.	2007 年，古生物學家肯尼斯·卡本特指出，甚至可能保存了內臟的痕跡；這在沒有詳細電腦斷層攝影和 X 光分析的情況下無法鑑定。
The skin was thin and delicate in relation to the size of the animal.	與動物的尺寸相比，皮膚較薄且脆弱。
As typical for dinosaurs, the skin consisted of non-overlapping scales called tubercles.	就像一般的恐龍一樣，皮膚是以稱為結節的重疊鱗片組成。
Two sorts of tubercles can be distinguished.	可區別出兩種結節。
Evenly distributed on the skin were the "ground tubercles", which were small, rounded scales between 1 and 3 mm (0.039 and 0.118 in) in diameter.	平均分佈在皮膚上的是「底部結節」，是小型、圓形的鱗片，直徑介於 1 到 3 公釐 (0.039 到 0.118 英吋) 之間。
The larger "pavement tubercles", less than 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter, were pentagonal in shape, raised relative to the ground tubercles, and arranged in irregular clusters interrupting the surface formed by the lower ground tubercles.	較大的「鋪面結節」直徑小於 5 公釐 (0.20 英吋)，形狀為五邊形，與底部結節相比較為凸起，而且以不規則的團塊排列，插在下方底部結節形成的表面中。
These clusters consisted of between twenty and several hundred individual pavement tubercles, and were bordered by intermediate tubercles which mediated in size and shape between ground and pavement tubercles.	這些團塊由二十到數百個單獨的鋪面結節所組成，而且與大小和形狀介於底部和鋪面結節之間的中型結節接壤。
In the chest and abdominal region, clusters were small, oval in shape and arranged in irregular longitudinal lines.	胸部和腹部區域的團塊較小，形狀為橢圓形，且以不規則的縱向線條排列。
They became larger towards the sides of the trunk, where they reached 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) in diameter; their shape became more irregular.	它們越靠近軀幹側邊就變得越大；在軀幹側邊，它們的直徑達到 5 到 10 公分 (2.0 到 3.9 英吋)；它們的形狀變得更不規則。
A cold front's location is at the leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as the leading edge of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough.	冷鋒的位置在溫度下降的前緣，在等溫線分析中顯示為等溫梯度的前緣，而且通常位在尖銳面低壓槽的內部。
Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in.	冷鋒移動速度最快可達暖鋒的兩倍，並產生較劇烈的天氣變化，因為冷空氣的密度比暖空氣高，而且冷空氣進入時會快速抬升暖空氣。
Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms.	冷鋒通常會伴隨狹窄的降雨帶和雷暴。
On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at the leading edge of the cooler air mass.	在天氣圖上，冷鋒的表面位置是以指向行進方向的藍色線條三角形/尖狀物 (點) 符號標示，位於冷氣團前緣。
Warm fronts mark the position on the Earth's surface where a relatively warm body of air has displaced colder air.	暖鋒在地表上的位置是相對溫暖的空氣體取代較冷空氣的地方。
The temperature increase is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lies within broader low pressure troughs than is the case with cold fronts.	溫度上升位於等溫線梯度往赤道方向的邊緣，而且所在的低壓槽比冷鋒更寬廣。
Warm fronts move more slowly than do the cold fronts because cold air is denser, and harder to displace from the Earth's surface.	暖鋒移動速度比冷鋒慢，因為冷空氣密度較高，而且較難從地表去除。
This causes temperature differences across warm fronts to be broader in scale.	這樣會導致暖鋒中的溫差範圍更大。
The warm air mass overrides the cold air mass and temperature changes occur at higher altitudes before those at the surface.	暖氣團會取代冷氣團，而且在較高海拔地表的暖氣團之前會發生溫度變化。
Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly stratiform and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches.	暖鋒前方的雲大部分是層狀雲，而且降雨會隨著鋒面接近而逐漸增加。
Fog can also occur preceding a warm front passage.	暖鋒過境的前方也可能會出現霧。
Clearing and warming is usually rapid after the passage of a warm front.	暖鋒過境後通常很快會放晴且變溫暖。
If the warm air mass is unstable, mixing of the warm moist air will produce thunderstorms that are embedded among the stratiform clouds ahead of the front, and after frontal passage, thundershowers may continue.	如果暖氣團不穩定，混合暖濕空氣後會產生嵌入在鋒面前方層狀雲之間的雷暴，而且在冷鋒過境之後，雷雨可能會持續。
On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of half circles pointing in the direction of travel.	在天氣圖上，暖鋒的表面位置是以指向行進方向的紅色線條半圓形來標示。
An occluded front is formed during the process of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front.	冷鋒取代暖鋒時，在氣旋生成過程中會形成囚錮鋒。
The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology.	冷鋒和暖鋒會自然地向兩極方向彎曲進入囚錮點，在氣象學上也稱為三相點。
It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold.	它位於尖銳的低壓槽內，但是邊界後面的氣團可能是暖空氣，也可能是冷空氣。
In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses.	在冷囚錮中，取代暖鋒的氣團溫度會低於暖鋒前方的冷空氣，而且會從兩個氣團下方穿越。
In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air.	在暖囚錮中，取代暖鋒的氣團溫度不會低於暖鋒前方的冷空氣，而且會從冷氣團上方行經，同時抬升暖空氣。
A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass.	囚錮鋒沿途可能會發現多種天氣變化，而且可能有雷暴，但是其過境通常會連帶使氣團變乾燥。
Though silvertip sharks are quite mobile, they exhibit fidelity to certain areas, with reports of territorial behavior.	雖然白邊真鯊相當具機動性，牠們經常出現在特定區域，而且有地域行為的相關報導。
They are usually encountered alone or in pairs.	牠們通常被發現是單獨或成對。
Small groups of adult females have been seen in deep water.	深水區曾經發現小群的成年雌性。
Individual silvertip sharks behave very aggressively towards one another, and many are heavily scarred.	白邊真鯊個體會互相表現出非常具攻擊性的行為，而且許多都帶有嚴重的傷痕。
They are also reported to dominate Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and blacktip sharks (C.	據報導，在爭奪食物時，牠們的地位也高於同樣大小的直翅真鯊 (C. galapagensis) 和黑邊鰭真鯊 (C.
limbatus) of equal size when competing for food.	limbatus)。
This shark sometimes forms mixed-species aggregations with grey reef sharks.	這種鯊魚有時候會與灰礁鯊組成混種群體。
Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against silvertip sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.	會跑的彩虹 (雙帶鰺) 曾被觀察到在白邊真鯊身上摩擦，利用鯊魚的粗糙表皮來刮除寄生蟲。
They sometimes follow marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in open water, and are themselves followed by pilot fish (Naucrates ductor).	牠們在開放海域有時會跟在海洋哺乳類後方，像是瓶鼻海豚 (寬吻海豚屬)，而本身則會被領航魚 (黑帶鰺) 跟隨。
Like the grey reef shark, the silvertip shark sometimes perform a stereotypical threat display if pursued by divers, warning that it is prepared to attack.	就像黑礁鯊一樣，如果白邊真鯊遭到潛水員追趕，有時候會做出典型的威脅表現，警告牠準備要攻擊了。
The display begins with the shark accelerating away to a distance of 15 m (49 ft), before turning and charging towards the perceived threat.	這種表現一開始是鯊魚加速游離至 15 公尺 (49 英呎) 距離處，然後轉向並衝向感知到的威脅。
At a distance of two body lengths, the shark brakes, turns broadside, drops its pectoral fins, gapes its jaws, lowers the posterior two-thirds of its body, and "shivers".	在兩個身長的距離處，鯊魚會煞車、轉向側面、降低胸鰭、張大嘴巴、將身體的後三分之二降低，然後「抖動」。
The last two elements of this display are unique to this species; the "shivering" may serve to emphasize its white fin markings.	這種表現的最後兩種元素是此種類專有的；「抖動」可能是為了強調牠的白色魚鰭斑紋。
If the diver persists, the shark may rapidly close in and slash with its upper teeth.	如果潛水員持續，鯊魚可能會快速接近並用上排牙齒揮擊。
The diet of the silvertip shark consists primarily of bony fishes, such as grouper, mackerel, tuna, escolars, lanternfish, flyingfish, wrasses, and soles.	白邊真鯊的食物主要包括硬骨魚，像是石斑魚、鯖魚、鮪魚、油魚、燈籠魚、飛魚、隆頭魚和比目魚。
Eagle rays, smaller sharks, and octopus are occasionally taken.	燕魟、小型鯊魚和章魚也偶爾會被捕捉。
Larger sharks tend to be more sluggish and take more benthic prey.	大型鯊魚較為遲鈍，而且會捕捉較深海的獵物。
The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of flesh with violent twists and turns.	牠們的上下顎有不同形狀的齒列，使牠們能夠對付大型獵物，透過猛烈扭轉來咬住和撕下肉塊。
Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food.	白邊真鯊曾被觀察到在其他種進食中的鯊魚群周邊游動，偶爾衝進去偷取食物。
This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.	此種類經常會接近船隻，因為牠們會受到特定人工低頻聲音所吸引。
From the 1990s onward an increasing amount of literature on Canadian comics has appeared, in both official languages.	1990 年代起開始出現越來越多有關加拿大漫畫的文學，且兩種官方語言都有。
Books such as Guardians of the North (1992) and Invaders from the North (2006) appeared by comics historian John Bell, who became senior archivist at Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa.	漫畫歷史學家約翰·貝爾出版的《北方守護者》(1992) 和《來自北方的侵略者》(2006) 等書籍，他之後成為渥太華的加拿大圖書和檔案系統的資深檔案保管員。
American magazine Alter Ego ran a special issue on Canadian comics in 2004.	美國雜誌《Alter Ego》在 2004 年刊登了有關加拿大漫畫的特刊。
Bart Beaty and Jeet Heer have been writing about comics academically and professionally, and regularly have articles educating the public on comics published in newspapers such as the National Post and the Boston Globe, as well as comics and literary magazines.	巴特·貝蒂和傑特·赫爾一直都在學術上及專業上撰寫與漫畫相關的內容，而且經常在報紙上發表向大眾介紹漫畫的文章，像是《國家郵報》和《波士頓環球報》，還有漫畫與文學雜誌。
Canadian feminist scholars such as Mary Louise Adams, Mona Gleason, and Janice Dickin McGinnis have done research into the anti-crime comics campaigns of the late 1940s and 1950s, from the point of view of the moral panic and social and legal history of the era, and the sociology of sexuality.	瑪莉·路易絲·亞當斯、莫娜·格里森和珍妮絲·狄金·麥金尼斯等加拿大女性主義學者，曾經從 1940 年代晚期和 1950 年代的道德恐慌和社會及法律歷史，以及性社會學的觀點，對該年代的反犯罪漫畫運動做過研究。
There are ten nursery schools, sixteen primary schools, and two secondary schools in Ashton-under-Lyne as of 2019.	截至 2019 年，Ashton-under-Lyne 有 10 幼稚園、16 所小學和 2 所中學。
In 2006, the council began a scheme to develop education in the borough by opening six new secondary schools.	在 2006 年，委員會開始一項計劃，目標是開設 6 所新中學來發展新區的教育。
Among the changes proposed as part of the £160 million scheme was the closure of Hartshead Sports College and Stamford Community High School, to be replaced by a 1,350-pupil academy with 300 sixth-form members.	在一項 1.6 億英鎊的計劃之一，提議的變化之一是關閉 Hartshead Sports 學院及 Stamford 社區高中，改為設立可招收 1,350 名學生的學院，其中包含 300 名預科學生。
In 2007, Hartshead Sports College was placed on "special measures" after it failed to achieve its targets for General Certificate of Secondary Education results and was criticised by Ofsted for its teaching standard.	2007 年，Hartshead 體育學院因未達成中等教育普通證書目標而對這所學校採取「特別措施」，並且其教學標準遭受教育標準局 (Ofsted) 批評。
The new academy opened in September 2008, a year ahead of schedule.	新學院於 2008 年 9 月開始招生，比原計劃提前一年。
It was named New Charter Academy (now Great Academy Ashton) after its sponsor, the New Charter Housing Trust.	在獲得 New Charter Housing Trust 贊助商資助後，該學院命名為 New Charter Academy (現稱為 Great Academy Ashton)。
The other secondary school in the town is St Damian's RC Science College, which was founded in 1963, and provides education for 800 pupils aged 11–16.	該鎮有另一所中學是 St Damian's RC Science College，成立於 1963 年並可招收 800 名 11–16 歲的學生。
As part of the Building Schools for the Future project, a replacement school building was built by Carillion and opened in May 2011.	作為在興建未來學校 (Building Schools for the Future) 專案中的一項計劃，Carillion 建造了一座替代校舍並於 2011 年 5 月開放。
Dale Grove School has 60 pupils and offers education for pupils aged 5–16 with special needs.	Dale Grove 學校有 60 名學生，為 5–16 歲有特殊需求的學生提供教育。

Tameside College also provides opportunities for further education and operates in Ashton-under-Lyne, Droylsden, and Hyde.	Tameside 學院也提供延續教育機會，並在 Ashton-under-Lyne、Droylsden 及 Hyde 營運。
Founded in 1954 and expanded in 1957 and 1964, it was originally called Ashton College.	該所學院成立於 1954 年並於 1957 及 1964 年擴建，原先的校名為 Ashton College。
In the early 19th century, Ashton-under-Lyne's growth made it necessary to find a new water supply.	在 19 世紀初，Ashton-under-Lyne 因持續發展而要尋找新的供水系統。
Before the introduction of piped water the town's inhabitants drew water from wells and the nearby River Tame.	在採用自來水之前，該鎮的居民的水源來自水井及附近的 River Tame 河。
Industrial processes had, however, polluted the river and the wells could not sustain a rapidly expanding population.	然而，工業製程使河流遭到污染，而且水井不足以供給迅速成長的人口。
From 1825, a private company was responsible for piping water from reservoirs, but there were still many homes without proper drainage or water supply.	從 1825 年開始，一家民營公司負責利用水庫管道供水，但是仍然有許多家庭沒有適當的排水或供水。
Waste management is now co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority.	廢水處理現在由當地主管機關 Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority 負責協調。
The first power station in Tameside was built in 1899, providing power for the area.	Tameside 的第一座發電站建立於 1899 年，為該地區提供電力。
Ashton's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is United Utilities; there are no power stations in the town.	Ashton 的配電網運營商是 United Utilities (聯合公用事業集團)；而該鎮沒有發電站。
United Utilities also manages the drinking and waste water.	United Utilities 也負責管理飲水及廢水。
In 1999, the Minneapolis Library Board issued a report entitled Outlook Twenty Ten identifying the changing needs of each of the system's libraries.	1999 年，Minneapolis 圖書館理事會發佈一份題為 Outlook Twenty (2000 年展望) 的報告，確定該系統的每間圖書館持續變化的需求。
Deeming Nokomis crowded and outdated, the report proposed three options.	該報告認為 Nokomis 擁擠且過時，因此提出三種選項。
Option A proposed combining Nokomis with the nearby Roosevelt Community Library in a 25,000-square-foot (2,323 m²) space and closing both Nokomis and Roosevelt.	選項 A 提議將 Nokomis 與附近的 Roosevelt 社區圖書館合併在 25,000 平方英呎 (2,323 m²) 的空間中，並且關閉 Nokomis 及 Roosevelt。
This would have allowed the library to operate out of a state-of-the-art building at an undecided location.	這將允許圖書館設立在未決定地點的最先進建築物處營運。
Option B recommended moving Nokomis to a different site without moving Roosevelt.	選項 B 建議將 Nokomis 搬遷到另一地點，但不需要搬遷 Roosevelt。
The new library there would have been 18,000 square feet (1,672 m²).	新建於該處的圖書館有 18,000 平方英呎 (1,672 m²)。
Option C included capital improvements to Nokomis, such as replacing carpeting, signs, and the roof.	選項 C 包括改善 Nokomis 的基礎建設，例如更換地毯、標誌和屋頂。
A 2003 update to the report identified a project start date of 2007, with full closure in 2008 and a reopening in 2009.	該報告於 2003 更新，確定專案開始日期為 2007 年，於 2008 年完全結案並於 2009 年重新開放。
In 2007, the Minneapolis City Council appropriated a portion of its $1.35 billion 2008 budget for improvements to Nokomis and Northeast Community Library. $5.2 million of the $7 million project came from the city; Hennepin County put forward $1.8 million for environmental additions to the library and other features.	2007 年，明尼亞波利斯 (Minneapolis) 市議會撥款的 13.5 億美元 2008 年預算中，有一部分用於改善 Nokomis 及 Northeast 社區圖書館。700 萬美元中的 520 萬美元來自該城市；Hennepin 郡撥出 180 萬美元用於增加圖書館的環境設施及其他佈置。
The new building was designed by KKE Architects with significant input from a citizen advisory committee.	全新的建築物由 KKE 建築師事務所設計，並且得到公民諮詢委員會的全力投入。.
Ebert, Inc. was hired as the general contractor.	Ebert, Inc. 公司獲聘為總承包商。
The old building's last day of operation was September 12, 2009, at which time it was reported in the Longfellow/Nokomis Messenger that the renovated library was expected to reopen sometime in the fall of the next year.	舊建築物的最後營運日是 2009 年 9 月 12 日，並且會在該日期於 Longfellow/Nokomis Messenger 上報導，翻新後的圖書館預計將在明年秋天重新開放。
During the construction, patrons were encouraged to make use of nearby libraries including East Lake, Roosevelt, Washburn, and Southdale.	施工期間，鼓勵讀者使用附近的圖書館，包括 East Lake、Roosevelt、Washburn 及 Southdale。
The renovation included expanding the size of the library about 4,300 square feet (399 m²) to a total size of 17,340 square feet (1,611 m²).	翻新工程包括將圖書館面積擴大約 4,300 平方英呎 (399 m²)，總面積為 17,340 平方英呎 (1,611 m²)。
A new lighting system that automatically adjusts based on the levels of light within the building was installed, along with a geothermal heating apparatus.	安裝的全新照明系統可根據建築物內的光量自動調整，並且已安裝地熱供暖設備。
Other environmentally friendly interior features included carpeting constructed from recycled fibers and low-flow faucets.	其他環保的內飾佈置包括再生纖維製成的地毯和低流量水龍頭。
A stormwater management system and native planting were utilized on the building's exterior.	建築物外部使用了雨水管理系統及原生植物。
The library once again incorporated materials from Mankato Kasota Stone, making the difference between the old and new exterior surfaces virtually indistinguishable.	圖書館再次採用來自 Mankato Kasota Stone 的材料，使新舊外觀之間的差異幾乎無法區別。
The teen section was significantly expanded and a new ground-floor meeting room was built.	已大幅擴大青少年區，並且在一樓建造新的會議室。
The children's section was also subject to improvements, gaining new nature-inspired design elements including bird light fixtures.	兒童區也有改善，並且設計靈魂採用自然元素，包括鳥形燈具。
Orthogenesis, also known as orthogenetic evolution, progressive evolution, evolutionary progress, or progressionism, is the biological hypothesis that organisms have an innate tendency to evolve in a definite direction towards some goal (teleology) due to some internal mechanism or "driving force".	定向進化 (也稱為漸進進化、演進進步或進步主義) 是生物學假設，生物體會，會由於一些內部機制或「驅動力」，而具有朝某目標 (目的論) 的明確方向進化的先天傾向。
According to the theory, the largest-scale trends in evolution have an absolute goal such as increasing biological complexity.	根據理論，最大規範的進化趨勢具有絕對目標，例如增加生物複雜性。
Prominent historical figures who have championed some form of evolutionary progress include Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and Henri Bergson.	支持某種形式進化進步的著名歷史人物包括 Jean-Baptiste Lamarck、Pierre Teilhard de Chardin 和 Henri Bergson。
The term orthogenesis was introduced by Wilhelm Haacke in 1893 and popularized by Theodor Eimer five years later.	「定向進化」 一詞由 Wilhelm Haacke 於 1893 年提出，五年後由 Theodor Eimer 推廣。
Proponents of orthogenesis had rejected the theory of natural selection as the organizing mechanism in evolution for a rectilinear model of directed evolution.	「定向進化」的支持者否決天擇論，認為這是定向進化直線模型的進化組織機制。
With the emergence of the modern synthesis, in which genetics was integrated with evolution, orthogenesis and other alternatives to Darwinism were largely abandoned by biologists, but the notion that evolution represents progress is still widely shared.	隨著結合遺傳學與進化論的現代演化綜論出現，生物學家很大程度上已捨棄定向進化和其他達爾文主義的替代理論，但是進化論代表進步的觀點仍然受到廣泛分享。
The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr made the term effectively taboo in the journal Nature in 1948, by stating that it implied "some supernatural force".	進化論生物學家 Ernst Mayr 在 1948 年的 Nature 雜誌上將此詞有力地定為禁忌，指出此詞暗示「某種超自然力量」。
The American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson (1953) attacked orthogenesis, linking it with vitalism by describing it as "the mysterious inner force".	美國古生物學家 George Gaylord Simpson (1953) 抨擊定向進化，將此詞描述為「神秘的內在力量」，並且與生機論相提並論。
Modern supporters include E. O.	現代支持者包括 E. O.、
Wilson and Simon Conway Morris, while museum displays and textbook illustrations continue to give the impression of progress in evolution.	Wilson 和 Simon Conway Morris，而博物館的展示和教科書插圖繼續散播進化進步的印象。
The philosopher of biology Michael Ruse notes that in popular culture evolution and progress are synonyms, while the unintentionally misleading image of the March of Progress, from apes to modern humans, has been widely imitated.	生物學哲學家 Michael Ruse 指出，在流行文化中，進化和進步是同義詞，而從猿類到現代人類的「人類進化圖」(March of Progress) 的無意誤導形象被廣泛模仿。
The term orthogenesis (from Ancient Greek ὀρθός orthós, "straight", and γένεσις génesis, "origin") was first used by the biologist Wilhelm Haacke in 1893.	生物學家 Wilhelm Haacke 於 1893 年首先使用定向進化 (orthogenesis   取自古希臘語 ὀρθός orthós「 straight」及 γένεσις génesis「origin」) 一詞。
Theodor Eimer was the first to give the word a definition; he defined orthogenesis as "the general law according to which evolutionary development takes place in a noticeable direction, above all in specialized groups".	Theodor Eimer 是第一位定義此詞的人；他將定向進化定義為「進化發展往明顯方向發生的通則，尤其在特殊族群」。
In 1922, the zoologist Michael F. Guyer wrote:	1922 年，動物學家 Michael F. Guyer 寫道：
[Orthogenesis] has meant many different things to many different people, ranging from a mystical inner perfecting principle, to merely a general trend in development due to the natural constitutional restrictions of the germinal materials, or to the physical limitations imposed by a narrow environment.	[定向進化] 對許多不同人的意義不同，從神秘的內在至善原則，到僅僅是由於肧芽材料的天生型態限制的總體發展趨勢，或由於狹窄環境所造成的物理限制。
In most modern statements of the theory, the idea of continuous and progressive change in one or more characters, due according to some to internal factors, according to others to external causes-evolution in a "straight line" seems to be the central idea.	在大多數現代理論的陳述中，由於根據內部因素、根據其他外部進化緣由，使一或多種特徵「直線」演化而持續及漸進變化的想法似乎成為中心思想。
According to Susan R. Schrepfer in 1983:	根據 Susan R. Schrepfer 於 1983 年的說法：
Orthogenesis meant literally "straight origins", or "straight line evolution".	定向進化字面上的意義是「直線起源」 或「直線進化」。
The term varied in meaning from the overtly vitalistic and theological to the mechanical.	此詞的含意涵蓋公然地生機論和神學到機械化。
It ranged from theories of mystical forces to mere descriptions of a general trend in development due to natural limitations of either the germinal material or the environment ...	範圍從神秘力量理論到僅僅描述由於胚芽材料或環境的天然限制的總體發展趨勢 ...
Few details are known about Smart's time at St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics.	關於 Smart 在聖盧克瘋子醫院 (St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics) 的時間，人們知之甚少。
He was admitted to St Luke's on 6 May 1757 as a "Curable Patient".	於1757 年 ５ 月 ６ 日，他被視為「可治癒的病人」送進聖路加醫院 (St Luke)。
It is possible that Smart was confined at Newbery's behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart's immorality in A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High.	Newbery 有可能因舊債及而且兩者之間的不良關係，而將 Smart 束之高閣；Newbery 曾在 A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High 中嘲笑 Smart 的不道德行為。
Regardless of Newbery's exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on madness.	無論 Newbery 的確切動機會何，有證據表明，Newbery 接納 Smart 進入精神病院不是因為發瘋。
To have Smart admitted, Newbery probably provided a small bribe, although bribes were against St Luke's policy.	Newbery 可能有支付一小筆賄賂要求收容 Smart，即使賄賂行為違背聖路加醫院 (St Luke) 的政策。
There is little information about Smart's condition during his stay at St Luke's, possibly because Battie's denied his patients from being visited, including by their own family members.	幾乎沒有關於 Smart 在聖路加醫院 (St Luke) 住院期間的病情方面的資訊，原因可能是 Battie 拒絕任何人探視他的病人，即使家人也不允許探視。
One of the few records that survive of Smart's time at St Luke's was an entry in St Luke's Minute Book, which read:	Smart 在聖路加醫院 (St Luke) 生活期間的很少數記錄之一是在聖路加醫院 (St Luke) 的議事錄中的一筆項目，內容中寫道：
12 May 1758	1758 年 5 月 12 日
Dr. Battie having acquainted this Committee that Christopher Smart (who was admitted on the 6th day of May 1757) continues disordered in his Senses notwithstanding he has been admitted into this Hospital above 12 Calendar Months and from the present Circumstances of his Case there is not Suffit.	Battie 向委員會通報，Christopher Smart (於 1757 年 5 月 6 日入院) 入院雖然已超過 12 個日曆月，但是感官上仍然精神錯亂，而且從目前的狀況觀察，沒有足夠的
reason to expect his speedy Recovery And he being brought up and examined.	理由可預期他迅速康復，並且正接受治療與檢查。
Ordered.	命令。
That he be discharged and that Notice be sent to his Securities to take him away.	他出院，並且通知寄他的擔保人帶他離開。
During Smart's confinement at St Luke's, not even other doctors were allowed to see Smart unless they had received personal permission from Battie.	Smart 拘禁在聖路加醫院 (St Luke) 期間，其他醫師也須獲得 Battie 的個人許可，否則不准為 Smart 看診。
It was improbable that Smart could have left the asylum without being released by Battie.	未獲 Battie 釋放的情況下，Smart 毫無可能離開精神病院。
Even if Smart would have attempted to obtain release via legal means, the rules for subpoenaing release would have been almost impossible to follow based on the system that Battie had in place, which isolated the individual from all contact.	即使 Smart 曾嘗試採取合法途徑獲得釋放，然而依據 Battie 制定的體制，個人須與所有聯絡人隔離，因此幾乎不可能遵循傳喚釋放規則。
Eventually, Smart was deemed "incurable" and would not have been released by the hospital but for its lack of funds.	最後，Smart 視為「無法治癒」，若非資金不足，否則無法出院。
There is little information about how and why Smart was released from asylum, but his daughter claimed: "He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness in placing him under necessary & salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure, invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more." What is known about the actual events is that John Sherratt, Christopher Smart's friend, believed that Smart's confinement was unfair and wanted to negotiate Smart's release.	關於 Smart 如何從精神病院出院及其原因的資訊很少，但他的女兒聲稱：「他的狀況好轉，但有些朋友的判斷有誤，而將這件事誤解為 Newbery 先生非常仁慈，在必要的情況下將 Smart 安置在精神病院且最終有可能治癒，而且邀請他共進晚餐，而不再被拘禁。」然而，已知的實際情況是，Christopher Smart 的朋友 John Sherratt 相信，Smart 被拘禁並不公平，且希望協商要求 Smart 出院。
In January 1763, he met with a parliamentary committee to discuss the issue of individuals falsely imprisoned and abuses that they would receive in asylums.	1763 年 1 月，他會見專責委員會，討論個人遭非法拘禁以及在精神病院受到虐待的問題。
In particular, Sherratt argued that many were admitted for habitual intoxication, which undermined Battie's and other asylum keeper's reputations.	尤其，Sherratt 提出，許多人因習慣性醉酒而入院，這損害了 Battie 和其他精神病院管理員的聲譽。
A finding by the parliamentary committee released 27 January 1763 bolstered Sherratt's chances to release Smart.	專責委員會於 1763 年 1 月 27 日公佈的調查結果增加 Sherratt 釋放 Smart 的機會。
Carl Michael Bellman is the central figure in Swedish song, known for his 1790 Fredman's Epistles and his 1791 Fredman's Songs.	Carl Michael Bellman 是瑞典歌曲的核心人物，以 1790 年的《Epistle 82 Fredman's Epistles》和 1791 年的《 Fredman's Songs》聞名。
He played the cittern, accompanying himself as he performed his songs at the royal court.	他在皇家宮廷表演時用隨身攜帶的西特琴演奏他的歌曲。
Jean Fredman is a fictional character and the supposed narrator in Bellman's epistles and songs, based on a real watchmaker of Bellman's Stockholm.	Jean Fredman 是根據 Bellman 的 Stockholm 真實鐘錶匠改編的虛構人物，也是 Bellman 貝爾曼的使徒書信和歌曲中的敘述者。
The epistles paint a picture of the demimonde life of the city during the eighteenth century, where strong drink and beautiful "nymphs" like Ulla Winblad create a rococo picture of life, blending classical allusion and pastoral description with harsh reality.	這些使徒書信描繪了十八世紀這座城市的半神生活，在那裡，烈性酒和像 Ulla Winblad 這樣的美麗「仙女」創造了一幅洛可可式的生活圖景，將古典典故和田園描述與殘酷的現實融為一體。
Epistle 82 has been recorded by Fred Åkerström, where it forms the title track of his third album of Bellman interpretations, as well as by Sven-Bertil Taube.	《Epistle 82》由 Fred Åkerström 錄製，並成為他的第三張專輯《Bellman interpretations》的主打歌，以及由 Sven-Bertil Taube 主唱。
It has been translated into English by Eva Toller.	這首歌已被 Eva Toller 翻譯成英文。
The song has featured in at least 16 Swedish films from 1929 onwards.	從 1929 年開始，這首歌至少在 16 部瑞典電影中出現過。
Lars Lönnroth, writing in Svenska Dagbladet, suggests that the "spring" in the Epistle was in fact not a stream in summer meadows but a fashionable spa, perhaps Djurgårsbrunn on what was in Bellman's time the edge of Stockholm.	Lars Lönnroth 在 Svenska Dagbladet 中寫道，書信中的「spring」實際上不是夏季草地上的一條小溪，而是時尚的溫泉，在 Bellman 時代，Djurgårsbrunn 也許在 Stockholm 的邊緣。
Henrik Mickos, in the 2011 Bellman lecture, discussed what the "pimpinella" of the first verse might be, concluding that salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) was quite likely, given it was known at the time as pimpinella, and was more common in Sweden then than it is now.	Henrik Mickos 在2011年的 Bellman演講中，討論了第一節的「茴芹 (pimpinella)」可能是什麼，結論是很有可能是小地榆種子 (salad burnet) (小地榆種子 (Sanguisorba minor))，因為當時稱為茴芹 (pimpinella)，並且在當時的瑞典比現在更常見。
Mickos dismisses the possibility that it was aniseed (Pimpinella anisum), which was used to flavour brännvin but not as the song has it ("red wine and pimpinella") a wine-based punch.	Mickos 駁斥了它是大茴香 (aniseed) (Pimpinella anisum) 的可能性，它被用來調味 brännvin，但不是像這首歌（「紅酒和茴芹」）那樣以葡萄酒為基底的潘趣酒。
Writing for The Boston Globe, Michael Andor Brodeur argued that while the show may feel like an advertisement for emoji, "the most satisfying part is watching self-proclaimed enthusiasts of the form stumble through their symbols once the difficulty is ever-so-slightly notched up....watching so much get lost in translation feels like a win.	Michael Andor Brodeur 為《波士頓環球報》(The Boston Globe) 撰稿，他認為，雖然這個節目可能感覺像是表情符號的廣告，但「最令人滿意的部分是，一旦難度越來越高，就會看到自稱是這種形式的狂熱者步步艱辛地理解他們的符號......看著這麼多東西在翻譯中迷失，感覺就像是一場勝利。
In terms of ratings, the series' first two episodes debuted to 336,000 and 322,000 respective viewers, with a 0.10 and 0.09 18–49 rating respectively.	在收視率方面，該劇的前兩集分別以 336,000 名和 322,000 名的觀眾首次亮相，收視率分別為 0.10 和0.09 18-49。
The episode followed up on the plot introduced in the final instalment of the second season in which a probe from an unknown alien race attacks Earth.	這一集延續了第二季最後一集中引入的情節，其中來自未知外星種族的探測器襲擊了地球。
A number of new sets and costumes were required, with preparations beginning for some departments up to three weeks before filming began.	一些部門在拍攝開始前三週就開始準備所需的一些新的佈景和服裝。
One change which was made was a new outfit for T'Pol, with costume tests taking place a week before filming began.	其中一項改變是為 T'Pol 穿上新衣服，服裝測試在拍攝開始前一週進行。
The redesign was because of studio executives wanting the show to appeal more to the 18–49 male demographic.	重新設計是因為電影公司行政製片人希望該節目更能吸引 18-49 歲的男性受眾。
The production team looked to the mid-series boost that the introduction of Seven of Nine provided on Star Trek: Voyager and sought for Enterprise to appeal to that demographic in the same manner.	製片團隊著眼於《星際爭霸戰：重返地球》(Star Trek: Voyager) 中推出的《九之七》(Seven of Nine) 所提供的系列中期提升，並尋求《企業號》(Enterprise) 以同樣的方式吸引這群受眾。
Kate O'Hara of New York Magazine later joked in reference to the change, "Women of the future will certainly choose to wear tight, uncomfortable, skin-tight catsuits!"	《紐約雜誌》(New York Magazine) 的 Kate O'Hara 後來提到此變化時開玩笑說，「未來的女性一定會選擇穿緊密、不舒服、皮膚緊密的貓服！」
"The Xindi" was seen as a new pilot by executive producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode.	《The Xindi》被執行製片人 Brannon Braga 和 Rick Berman 視為新的領航員，他們也寫了這一集。
Braga said "We were re-establishing an Enterprise that was going to be a little bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms." They felt the best way to do this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to do in order to introduce them as well.	Braga 說：「我們正在重建《企業號》(Enterprise)，今年會有點不同，所以我們必須從這些角度來考慮」。他們認為最好的方法是立即向觀眾展示《The Xindi》，並讓 MACO 做一些事情進行介紹。
He called it a "big episode" as they sought to set up the rest of season.	這一集試圖設置本季的其餘部分，所以 Braga 稱這是「大插曲」
The shoot began on June 26, 2003, with the expectation that it would take nine days (as opposed to the usual seven) to complete.	於 2003 年 6 月 26 日開始拍攝，預計需要九天（而不是通常的七天）才能完成。
One of the special effects on the episode used ground Styrofoam which had been painted blue and processed through a wood chipper.	該集的特效之一使用研磨的聚苯乙烯發泡塑料，該發泡塑料被漆成藍色並使用木屑切割機加工而成，
It was used to represent the mineral Trellium-D within the mine.	被用來代表礦井內的礦物 Trellium-D。
However, the ground Styrofoam stuck to the actors' shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed.	然而，研磨的聚苯乙烯發泡塑料黏在演員的鞋子和服裝上，最終遍佈整個拍攝該劇集的派拉蒙片廠。
It would turn up in unexpected places on set for the rest of the series, and was found in among the sets as they were being dismantled after the end of season four.	在劇集的其餘部分，它將出現在片場意想不到的地方，並在第四季結束後被拆除時在佈景中被發現。
"The Xindi" featured several actors who would go on to recur in their roles throughout the third season of Enterprise.	《The Xindi》中出現了幾位演員，他們在整個《企業號》(Enterprise) 第三季中反覆出現。
These included the MACO marines under the command of Major Hayes, played by Steven Culp.	其中包括 Major Hayes 少校 (Steven Culp 飾演) 指揮的 MACO 海軍陸戰隊。
At the time of his appearance in "The Xindi", he felt that he did not have any characterisation to work with.	在《The Xindi》中出場時，他覺得自己沒有任何人物刻畫可言。
During the production of his second episode, "The Shipment", Culp read an article in the Los Angeles Times about a troubled youth who joined the military and in serving in the Iraq War had found himself.	在他的第二集《The Shipment》的製片過程中，Culp 在《洛杉磯時報》(Los Angeles Times) 上讀到一篇文章，講述了一個陷入困境的年輕人加入軍隊並在伊拉克戰爭中服役時發現自我。
After discussing it with the director, this became the basis for the character.	在與導演討論之後，這成為了角色的基礎。
Daniel Dae Kim made his first of three appearances in "The Xindi" as Corporal Chang; he had previously appeared as Gotana-Retz in the Voyager episode "Blink of an Eye".	Daniel Dae Kim 在《The Xindi》中首次出場，飾演張下士 (Corporal Chang)。他之前曾在《重返地球》(Voyager) 的《Blink of an Eye》一集中以 Gotana-Retz 的身份出現。
The band were afforded more time to record than previous endeavors, and were listening to music such as Jawbreaker, Bad Religion and Lagwagon, which influenced the album.	樂隊比以前努力有更多的時間來錄製，並且正在聽Jawbreaker、Bad Religion和Lagwagon等音樂，這些音樂影響了專輯。
For production duties, the band worked with Mark Trombino, who provided additional piano and keyboards on Dude Ranch.	對於製片職責，樂隊與 Mark Trombino 合作，後者在 Dude Ranch 提供了額外的鋼琴和鍵盤。
The trio picked him based on his work he had done on Jimmy Eat World's Static Prevails (1996). The group spent time trying to amuse Trombino, to no avail.	三人根據他在 Jimmy Eat World 的 Static Prevails (1996) 的表現而選擇他。這群人花時間試圖逗樂 Trombino，但無濟於事。
Hoppus' sister, Anne Hoppus, described Trombino as very quiet during the sessions.	Hoppus 的妹妹安妮·Anne Hoppus 形容 Trombino 在會議期間非常安靜。
Trombino, in a retrospective piece about the album, mentioned that he was "excited, but also nervous and intimidated.	Trombino 在一篇關於這張專輯的回顧文章中提到他「很興奮，但也很緊張和害怕。
I felt weird that there were these guys who had sold way more records than I had ever sold and I'm sitting in the producer’s chair telling them what to do." Dude Ranch was recorded Big Fish Studios in Rancho Santa Fe, California in December 1996.	我覺得很奇怪，有這些傢伙賣出的唱片比我賣的唱片多得多，我坐在製作人的椅子上告訴他們該怎麼做。」Dude Ranch 於 1996 年 12 月在加利福尼亞州 Rancho Santa Fe 錄製了《Big Fish Studios》。
Big Fish was a converted guesthouse which had just survived a wildfire months before.	Big Fish 是一家經過改建的民宿，幾個月前剛剛在野火中倖存下來。
However, the gloomy atmosphere did not faze Blink-182 at all, and what was a tragedy to local individuals became fodder for jokes for the group.	然而，陰鬱的氣氛絲毫沒有讓 Blink-182 感到沮喪，對當地人來說是一個悲劇，郤成為樂團笑話的素材。
Bassist Mark Hoppus had just bought a new video camera and he filmed stunts with guitarist Tom DeLonge on the burnt landscape in spare time.	貝斯手 Mark Hoppus 剛剛買了一台新的攝影機，他在業餘時間與吉他手 Tom DeLonge 一起在燃燒的風景中拍攝特技。
Despite this, Trombino was impressed by their work ethic: "They were the most business-centric band I'd ever seen at that point.	儘管如此，Trombino 還是對他們的職業道德印象深刻：「他們是我當時見過的最商業優先的樂隊。
They had their shit together."	他們一起吃了屎。」
Despite the creative boom while writing lyrics for the album, all three members of Blink-182 faced setbacks while recording Dude Ranch.	儘管在為專輯寫歌詞時創意源源不絕，但 Blink-182 的所有三名成員在錄製《Dude Ranch》時都遇到了挫折。
DeLonge was having vocal problems and spent much time recording and re-recording vocal tracks, and Hoppus realized he too was having difficulty singing after losing his voice during a one-off Christmas concert.	DeLonge 的聲音有問題，花了很多時間錄製和重新錄製聲樂曲目，Hoppus 意識到他在獨場聖誕音樂會上失聲後也很難唱歌。
Hoppus realized the magnitude of the situation and cancelled the final week of recording in December 1996.	Hoppus 意識到情況的嚴重性，並於 1996 年 12 月取消了最後一週的錄製。
He quit smoking in order to take care of his voice, which was stressed due to lack of vocal warm-ups, full days of vocal tracks, and the strain of singing for "Dammit", which was accidentally written just outside his vocal range.	他戒煙是為了照顧自己的嗓音，由於缺乏聲樂熱身，整天的聲樂曲目以及為「Dammit」唱歌的壓力而受到壓力，「Dammit」意外地寫在他的音域之外。
Meanwhile, Raynor had to record his drum tracks while still in his wheelchair, the result of injuries sustained at the signing party.	與此同時，Raynor 由於在簽名會上受傷而不得不在輪椅上錄製他的鼓聲。
He would wheelchair up to the drum set and scoot onto the drum throne and play," remembered Trombino in a later interview.	「他會坐到鼓臺上，然後躡手躡腳地坐在鼓座上玩，」Trombino 在後來的一次採訪中回憶道。
"I got the sense that [the band] were bummed." Aside from the recording, the band spent time playing Crash Bandicoot and "reading the articles from the shelves and shelves of Playboys that the studio had thoughtfully provided." The group ate lunch nearly each day at Sombrero, a local Mexican restaurant namedropped in "Josie", and Chinese for dinner from Encinitas' Pick Up Stix.	「我感覺到 [樂隊] 很沮喪」。除了錄音之外，樂隊還花時間演奏 Crash Bandicoot，並「閱讀工作室精心提供的書架上文章和花花公子」。這群人幾乎每天都在 Sombrero 吃午餐，Sombrero 是一家以「Josie」命名的墨西哥當地餐廳，還有 Encinitas 的 Pick Up Stix 的中式晚餐。
It would be January 1997 until the band would be able to wrap up sessions for Dude Ranch, eventually amounting to five weeks of recording.	直到 1997 年 1 月，樂隊才能夠完成 Dude Ranch 專輯，最終相當於五週的錄製。
For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using a sound-effects machine he owned.	在收尾工作中，Unwrite Law 的主唱 Scott Russo 獻出幾首曲目給向「Josie」，Trombino 讓 Blink-182 使用他擁有的音效機在幾首歌曲之間錄製了笑話。
Plunketts Creek is in the West Branch Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Susquehannocks.	Plunketts Creek 位於薩斯奎哈納河西支 (West Branch Susquehanna River) 河流域，其中薩斯奎漢諾克斯 (Susquehannocks) 族群是最早記錄的居民。
Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes.	由於疾病和與易洛魁五國的戰爭，他們的數量大幅減少，到 1675 年，他們已經滅絕，搬走或被同化到其他部落。
The West Branch Susquehanna River valley was subsequently under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who invited displaced tribes, including the Lenape (Delaware) and Shawnee to live in the lands vacated by the Susquehannocks.	薩斯奎哈納河西支河谷隨後在易洛魁聯盟 (Iroquois) 的名義控制之下，易洛魁聯盟邀請流離失所的部落，包括莱纳佩族 (Lenape) (德拉瓦州) 和肖尼族 (Shawnee) 居住在薩斯奎漢諾克族騰出的土地上。
The French and Indian War (1754–1763) led to the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin.	法國和印第安人戰爭（1754 年至 1763 年）導致許多美洲原住民向西遷移到俄亥俄河流域。
On November 5, 1768, the British acquired the New Purchase from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, including what is now Plunketts Creek.	1768 年 11 月 5 日，英國在《斯坦威克斯堡條約》(Treaty of Fort Stanwix)中從易洛魁聯盟手中收購了新買點，包括現在的普朗克提溪 (Plunketts Creek)。
The first settlement along the creek by European colonists took place between 1770 and 1776.	歐洲殖民者沿著小溪的第一個定居點發生在 1770 年至 1776 年之間。
Plunketts Creek is named for Colonel William Plunkett, a physician, who was the first president judge of Northumberland County after it was formed in 1772.	普朗克提溪 (Plunketts Creek) 以醫生 William Plunkett 上校的名字命名，他是諾森伯蘭郡 (Northumberland County) 在 1772 年成立以來的第一任首席法官。
During conflicts with Native Americans, he treated wounded settlers and fought the natives.	在與美洲原住民的衝突中，他治療受傷的定居者並與當地人作戰。
Plunkett led a Pennsylvania expedition in the Pennamite-Yankee War to forcibly remove settlers from Connecticut, who had claimed and settled on lands in the Wyoming Valley also claimed by Pennsylvania.	Plunkett 在賓那邁與揚基之戰 (pennamite-yankee wars) 中領導賓夕法尼亞州探險隊，強行將定居者從康涅狄格州驅逐出去，這些定居者主張並定居在懷俄明河谷 (Wyoming Valley) 的土地上，賓夕法尼亞州也聲稱擁有主權。
For his services, Plunkett was granted six tracts of land that totaled 1,978 acres (800 ha) on November 14, 1776, although the land was not actually surveyed until September 1783.	由於他的服務，Plunkett 在 1776 年 11 月 14 日獲得了六塊土地，總面積為 1,978 英畝（800 公頃），儘管直到 1783 年 9 月才實際勘測了這片土地。
Plunkett's land included the creek's mouth, so Plunketts Creek was given his name.	Plunkett 的土地包括小溪的河口，所以普朗克提溪 (Plunketts Creek) 以他的名字命名。
He died in 1791, aged about 100, and was buried in Northumberland without a grave marker or monument (except for the creek that bears his name).	他於 1791 年去世，享年約 100 歲，被埋葬在諾森伯蘭郡 (Northumberland)，沒有墓碑或紀念碑（以他的名字命名的小溪除外）。
Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County in 1795.	萊康明縣 (Lycoming) 於1795年從諾森伯蘭郡成立。
When Plunketts Creek Township was formed in Lycoming County in 1838, the original name proposed was "Plunkett Township", but Plunkett's lack of active support for the American Revolution some years earlier had led some to believe his loyalty lay with the British Empire.	當 Plunketts Creek Township 於 1838 年在萊康明縣成立時，最初提議的名稱是「Plunkett Township」，但 Plunkett 幾年前未積極支持美國革命，導致一些人認為他的忠誠在於大英帝國。
The lingering suspicion of his loyalist sympathies led to the proposed name being rejected.	對他的忠誠同情揮之不去的懷疑導致提議的名字被拒絕。
Naming the township for the creek rather than its namesake was seen as an acceptable compromise.	用其同名命名小溪 (而不是該鎮) 視為可接受的折衷方案。
In 1832, John Barbour built a sawmill on Loyalsock Creek near the mouth of Plunketts Creek.	1832 年，約翰·巴伯 (John Barbour) 在 Plunketts Creek 河口附近的Loyalsock Creek上建造了一家鋸木廠。
This developed into the village of Barbours Mills, today known as Barbours.	這發展成為 Barbours Mills 村，現今稱為 Barbours。
In the 19th century, Barbours had several blacksmiths, a temperance hotel, post office, many sawmills, a school, store and wagon maker.	在 19 世紀，Barbours 有幾家鐵匠鋪、一家不賣酒的旅館、郵局、許多鋸木廠、一所學校、商店和馬車製造商。
In 1840, a road was built north from Barbours along Plunketts Creek, crossing it several times.	1840 年，從 Barbours 沿著 Plunketts Creek 向北修建了一條道路，多次穿過。
Rubidium was discovered in 1861 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, in Heidelberg, Germany, in the mineral lepidolite through flame spectroscopy.	1861 年，年由 Robert Bunsen 和 Gustav Kirchhoff 在德國海德堡利用火焰光譜法在礦物鋰雲母中發現銣。
Because of the bright red lines in its emission spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word rubidus, meaning "deep red".	由於銣發射光譜中有鮮豔的紅色線條，因為選擇了源自拉丁語 rubidus 的名字，意思是「深紅色」。
Rubidium is a minor component in lepidolite.	銣是鋰雲母中的次要成分。
Kirchhoff and Bunsen processed 150 kg of a lepidolite containing only 0.24% rubidium oxide (Rb₂O).	Kirchhoff 和 Bunsen 加工了 150 千克僅含有 0.24% 氧化銣 (Rb₂O) 的鋰雲母。 
Both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid, but those salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water.	鉀和銣都與氯鉑酸 (chloroplatinic acid) 形成不溶性鹽，但這些鹽在熱水中的溶解度略有不同。
Therefore, the less soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate (Rb₂PtCl₆) could be obtained by fractional crystallization.	因此，藉由分級結晶可以獲得可溶性較低的六氯鉑酸銣 (Rb₂PtCl₆)。
After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen, the process yielded 0.51 grams of rubidium chloride for further studies.	用氫氣還原六氯鉑酸鹽的過程產生 0.51 克氯化銣，用於進一步研究。
Bunsen and Kirchhoff began their first large-scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds with 44,000 litres (12,000 US gal) of mineral water, which yielded 7.3 grams of caesium chloride and 9.2 grams of rubidium chloride.	Bunsen 和 Kirchhoff 開始用 44,000 升（12,000 美制加侖）礦泉水首次大規模分離銫和銨化合物，產生 7.3 克氯化銫和 9.2 克氯化銨。
Rubidium was the second element, shortly after caesium, to be discovered by spectroscopy, just one year after the invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.	繼銫之後不久，就在 Bunsen 和 Kirchhoff 發明光譜儀一年後，銣是採用光譜學發現的第二種元素。
The two scientists used the rubidium chloride to estimate that the atomic weight of the new element was 85.36 (the currently accepted value is 85.47).	兩位科學家使用氯化銣來估計新元素的原子量為 85.36（目前公認的值為 85.47）。
They tried to generate elemental rubidium by electrolysis of molten rubidium chloride, but instead of a metal, they obtained a blue homogeneous substance, which "neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope showed the slightest trace of metallic substance".	他們試圖利用電解熔融的氯化銣來產生元素銣，但他們獲得的不是金屬，而是藍色均勻的物質，「在肉眼下和顯微鏡下都沒有顯示出絲毫的微量金屬物質」。
They presumed that it was a subchloride (Rb	他們推測這是一種次氯化物 (Rb
₂Cl); however, the product was probably a colloidal mixture of the metal and rubidium chloride.	₂Cl)；然而，該產物可能是金屬和氯化銣的膠體混合物。
In a second attempt to produce metallic rubidium, Bunsen was able to reduce rubidium by heating charred rubidium tartrate.	在第二次嘗試產生金屬銣時，Bunsen 能夠藉由加熱燒焦的酒石酸銣來減少銣。
Although the distilled rubidium was pyrophoric, they were able to determine the density and the melting point.	雖然蒸餾出的銣是發火性，但他們能夠確定密度和熔點。
The quality of this research in the 1860s can be appraised by the fact that their determined density differs by less than 0.1 g/cm³ and the melting point by less than 1 °C from the presently accepted values.	19 世紀 60 年代，這項研究的品質可以通過以下事實來評估：經判定的密度與目前接受的值相差小於 0.1 g/cm³，熔點相差不到 1°C。
The slight radioactivity of rubidium was discovered in 1908, but that was before the theory of isotopes was established in 1910, and the low level of activity (half-life greater than 10¹⁰ years) made interpretation complicated.	在 1908 年發現銣有輕微放射性，但這是在 1910 年同位素理論建立之前所發現，低程度的活性（半衰期大於 10¹⁰ 年）使解釋變得複雜。
The now proven decay of ⁸⁷Rb to stable ⁸⁷Sr through beta decay was still under discussion in the late 1940s.	20 世紀 40 年代末所討論，⁸⁷Rb透過 beta 衰變而衰變到穩定的 ⁸⁷Sr，現在已得到證實。
Rubidium had minimal industrial value before the 1920s.	銣在 1920 年代之前具有最低限度的工業價值。
Since then, the most important use of rubidium is research and development, primarily in chemical and electronic applications.	從那時起，銣最重要的用途是研究和開發，主要用於化學和電子應用。
The history of the tea processing corresponds intimately with the role that tea played in Chinese society and the preferred methods of its consumption in ancient Chinese society.	茶葉加工的歷史與中國古代社會茶葉所扮演的角色及其首選的消費方式密切相關。
Variations of these processing techniques are still used in modern tea processing albeit being far more mechanized.	這些加工技術的變體仍然用於現代茶葉加工，儘管機械化程度要高得多。
The ancient Chinese society first encountered the tea plant in what is now southern China and processed it as another medicinal herb for use in Chinese herbology.	中國古代社會首先在現在的中國南方遇到茶樹，並將其加工成另一種藥草，用於中草藥學。
The processing technique used to process fresh tea leaves was to immediately steam the fresh tea leaves and dry them for preservation, which is likely the most ancient Chinese form of tea leaf processing.	用於加工新鮮茶葉的加工技術是立即蒸新鮮茶葉並乾燥保存，這可能是中國最古老的茶葉加工形式。
This processing method was perfected near the end of the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) and produced a dried tea that would be classified today as "green tea" and quite similar to modern Japanese sencha.	這種加工方法在漢朝末期（西元前 206 年至西元 220 年）已臻至完美，並生產出一種乾茶，今天被歸類為「綠茶」，與現代日本煎茶非常相似。
For consumption, dried tea leaves were either decocted with water around with other herbs, or ground into a powder to be taken straight, or in a liquid in the manner of matcha.	食用時，乾茶葉可用水與其他草藥一起調製，也可以直取研磨成粉末，或以抹茶的方式在液體中。
With the increase of tea's use in Chinese herbology, production methods changed, where the processed green tea leaves were not immediately dried after steaming.	隨著中國草藥學中葉愈來愈廣泛使用茶，生產方法發生了變化，其中加工過的綠茶葉在蒸煮後立即乾燥。
Rather the steamed tea leaves were first pulverized into a paste form, with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea, a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea.	相反，蒸熟的茶葉首先被粉碎成糊狀，然後糊狀物在模具中形成並慢慢乾燥成磚茶，這是陸羽在他的作品「茶經」中詳細描述的技術。
Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used, as older mature tea leaves were preferred for tea production.	通常不使用嫩葉和葉芽，因為較老的成熟茶葉是茶葉生產的首選。
Some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves, which typically required the use of a cooked rice slurry (米湯) to bind the tea brick together.	一些茶磚也是由成熟的整片葉子製成的，這通常需要使用煮熟的米漿（米湯）將茶磚黏合在一起。
The preference of producing tea in brick form possibly stems from the fact that it can be more easily transported and stored.	生產磚砌茶葉的偏好可能源於可以更容易地運輸和儲存的事實。
The use of steam in fixation (殺青) of tea leaf enzymes is an important step in processing tea, with the leaves quickly cooled down and then undergoing further processing.	使用蒸青（殺青）茶葉酶是加工茶葉的重要步驟，過程中葉子迅速冷卻，然後進行進一步加工。
The less tightly controlled methods of it in the past resulted in the creation of "yellow tea" when the tea leaves were over-steamed for fixation or were not quickly spread out, doused with water and cooled.	當茶葉被過度蒸青或未迅速攤開，用水澆滅並冷卻時，過去不太嚴格控制的方法導致產生「黃茶」。
Although green tea was the most popular in Lu Yu's time, he personally considered yellow tea to be superior to green.	雖然陸羽時代綠茶最受歡迎，但他個人認為黃茶優於綠茶。
Even when the leaves were quickly cooled, if they are left in piles (渥堆) for too long before processing, the leaves will begin to undergo microbial fermentation to produce "post-fermented tea".	即使葉子快速冷卻，如果在加工前葉子疊成堆（渥堆）太久，葉子也會開始經歷微生物發酵而產生「發酵後茶」。
This technique is somewhat similar to composting, albeit tightly controlled, and still used in the production of Liu'an tea (安徽六安籃茶) and was more recently introduced for the production of the "ripe" type pu-erh tea.	這種技術有點類似於堆肥，儘管受到嚴格控制，並且仍然用於生產安徽六安茶（安徽六安籃茶），並且最近被引入用於生產「成熟」型普洱茶。
The production of tea in brick forms and their storage also resulted in another type of post-fermented tea, which was produced by aging.	磚狀茶葉的生產和儲存也導致採用陳放所產生的另一種類型黑茶 (post-fermented tea)。
The long transport and storage times of the day unwittingly allowed the tea bricks to undergo prolonged exposure to the elements and to various microflora, which resulted in the aging, oxidation, and fermentation of green brick teas.	一天中漫長的運輸和儲存時間無意中使茶磚長時間暴露於元素和各種微生物群落中，導致綠磚茶的老化、氧化和發酵。
A brick of green tea that had been stored and aged into post-fermented tea was charred over charcoal to rid it of the layer of detritus, dust, and shiny multicoloured growths before being broken down into a powder, cooked, and then consumed.	已經儲存並陳放成發酵後茶的綠茶磚在木炭上燒焦，以清除碎屑、灰塵和閃亮的多色生長物，然後被分解成粉末、煮熟，然後食用。
By the end of Tang Dynasty (618-907CE) green, yellow, and post-fermented tea was commonly used in China and moved from purely being used in herbology to becoming a beverage drunk for pleasure.	到唐朝末期（西元 618-907 年），綠茶、黃茶和黑茶在中國被普遍使用，並從純粹草藥用途轉變為飲料。

Quinn invites Puck to babysit with her and the two bond, however when Quinn discovers that Puck spent the evening sexting his ex-girlfriend Santana (Naya Rivera), she re-commits to having the baby adopted, believing her daughter deserves a better father.	Quinn 邀請 Puck 與她和兩人一起照看孩子，然而當 Quinn 發現 Puck 花了一整晚的時間與他的前女友 Santana (Naya Rivera 飾) 發生性關係時，她再次承諾收養孩子，相信她的女兒應該有更好的父親。
Kurt (Chris Colfer) gives Rachel a make-over, ostensibly to help her attract Finn, but in reality attempting to sabotage her chances with him.	Kurt (Chris Colfer 飾) 給 Rachel 改頭換面，表面上是為了協助她吸引 Finn，但實際上卻試圖破壞倆人相處的機會。
Finn is unimpressed with Rachel's new look before telling her he remembered having the conversation with Kurt about what he liked in girls.	Finn 對 Rachel 的新造型並不感興趣，然後告訴她，他記得和 Kurt 談論過他喜歡的女孩類型。
Rachel confronts Kurt, stating that even if he is in love with Finn, she will always have a better chance "because [she's] a girl".	Rachel 質問 Kurt 特，說即使他愛上了 Finn，她也總會有更好的機會，「因為她是個女孩」。
But Kurt tells her that they are both kidding themselves: Finn is in love with Quinn and nothing will change that.	但 Kurt 特告訴她，他們都在開玩笑：Finn 愛上了 Quinn，沒有什麼能改變這一點。

SH-58 was first commissioned some time between March 1, 1930 and December 1, 1931.	SH-58 在 1930 年 3 月 1 日至 1931 年 12 月 1 日之間首次投入使用。
The original extent of the route was much shorter than the present highway.	路線的原始範圍比現在的高速公路短得多。
In 1931, SH-58 was a dirt road extending from SH-8 east of Fairview north to Ringwood.	1931 年，SH-58 是一條從 Fairview 以北延伸到 Ringwood 的 SH-8 的土路。
Prior to receiving the SH-58 designation, this section of road was part of US-164 and the first SH-13.	在獲得 SH-58 指定之前，這段路是 US-164 和第一條 SH-13 的一部分。
On May 29, 1930, AASHO approved an extension of US-60 that replaced US-164.	1930 年 5 月 29 日，AASHO 批准了 US-60 的延期，取代了 US-164。
When US-60 replaced US-164 through the area, it was changed to the more westerly route it takes in the present day.	當 US-60 取代 US-164 通過該地區時，它被改為今天更向西的路線。
The section of old U.S. highway that no longer had a designation became SH-58.	不再有名稱的舊美國高速公路部分成為 SH-58。
Throughout the 1930s, SH-58 was expanded in both directions.	在整個 1930 年代，SH-58 雙向都有擴展。
The first addition to the highway came during the first half of 1932, when the highway was extended north to Helena.	高速公路的第一次擴建是在 1932 年上半年，當時高速公路向北延伸至 Helena。
No east–west highway existed at this point yet, leading to a spur end.	此時還沒有東西向高速公路，導致支線末端。
The highway was extended to the south, replacing SH-44, to Canton on March 29, 1937. SH-58 was extended north to the Kansas state line sometime between April 1937 and April 1938.	1937 年 3 月 29 日，高速公路向南延伸，取代 SH-44，通往坎頓 (Canton)。SH-58 在 1937 年 4 月至 1938 年 4 月的某個時候向北延伸至堪薩斯州 (Kansas) 線。
This final extension brought SH-58's northern section to its present-day termini, and no major changes to the northern section have occurred since.	最後的延伸使 SH-58 的北段成為現在的終點站，此後北段沒有發生重大變化。
SH-58's southern section was first established on October 16, 1945, when SH-54 was given a new alignment further to the west; its old alignment was redesignated as SH-58.	SH-58 的南段最初建立於 1945 年 10 月 16 日，當時 SH-54 被賦予了進一步向西的新路線；它的舊路線被重新命名為 SH-58。
The original routing of SH-58's southern section began at US-277 in Cyril, continued west through Apache, and turned north at the present-day western intersection of with SH-19.	SH-58 南段的原始路線始於西里爾 (Cyril) 的 US-277，繼續向西穿過阿帕奇，並在今天與 SH-19 的西部交叉口向北轉彎。
SH-58 continued north along its present alignment to Hydro, where it ended at US-66/SH-1.	SH-58 繼續向北沿著目前的路線延行至海德羅 (Hydro)，並在此處以 US-66 / SH-1 結束。
In 1955, SH-19 was established through southern Caddo County, taking over the east–west section of SH-58.	1955 年，建造的 SH-19 通過卡多郡 (Caddo County) 南部，銜接 SH-58 的東西向路段。
Thus, SH-58 was truncated to where it intersected with SH-19 (the present day western end of their concurrency).	因此，SH-58在與SH-19相交的位置處 (現在並行的西端) 截斷。
SH-58 was extended to its present terminus north of Hydro the next year.	第二年，SH-58 被延長到海德羅 (Hydro) 以北的現在終點站。
The highway was further extended in 1964, bringing the southern terminus to its present location near Medicine Park.	高速公路於 1964 年進一步延伸，將南部終點站帶到現在的 Medicine Park 附近。
No further routing changes have occurred since then.	此後，沒有進一步的路線更改。

The concert audio was mixed by Rick Camp, the same engineer who mixed at the concert venues.	音樂會音訊由 Rick Camp 混音，他是在音樂會場地混音的工程師。
It is uncommon for mix engineers to specialize in both live and recorded mixing.	混音工程師專門從事現場混音和錄音混音並不常見。
For Camp, "Mixing Beyoncé is a pleasure because she's a real singer and makes it easy.	對於 Camp 來說，「與 Beyoncé 混音是一種樂趣，因為她是一位真正的歌手，並且輕鬆自在。
There is hardly an overdub on this project — it's 95 percent live Beyoncé." He further talked about the collaboration with Beyoncé with Mix magazine, saying: "In my 22 years of mixing, I've never come across anyone who could deliver like she does: vocally and her ability to do a show.	這項現場工作幾乎沒有過度配音，是 95% 的現場 Beyoncé」。他進一步談到了與 Beyoncé 與《Mix》雜誌的合作，他說：「在我 22 年的混音生涯中，我從未遇到過任何能像她一樣美聲和秀場表演的能力俱佳的人。
I've seen this young woman run across a 60-foot stage, hit every note and never miss a thing.	我見過這位年輕女子跑過 60 英尺高的舞臺，每個音符完美詮釋，從不錯過任何細節。
And that makes my job so much easier."	這讓我更輕鬆完成工作。」
On stage, Beyoncé was backed by several male and female dancers performing choreography during the show.	在舞臺上，Beyoncé 在演出期間獲得幾位男女舞者傾力合作編舞與表演。
DJ Diamond who served as a DJ during the performances and a backing band provided the music.	DJ Diamond 在演出期間擔任 DJ，並由一支後援樂隊提供音樂。
The performance starts with footage of the crowd during the concert cheering before the appearance of Beyoncé.	表演從演唱會期間人群在  Beyoncé  出現之前歡呼的鏡頭開始。
The curtains are lifted to reveal the stage and Beyoncé appears in red clothes hanging upside down while being taken to a sofa on the stage with a harness singing "Baby Boy".	幕簾被掀起，露出舞臺，Beyoncé 穿著紅色的衣服，用背帶倒掛著帶到舞臺上的沙發上，唱著「Baby Boy」。
She is backed by a big screen and several dancers on stage who perform a choreography around her.	她身後有一個大螢幕和舞臺上圍繞著她伴舞的幾位舞者。
She later starts dancing with them as the song plays and a breakdown towards the end is also featured.	後來，當歌曲播放時，她開始與舞群一起跳舞，並且朝向結尾的分解也是特色。
She asks from the girls in the crowd to sing to "Naughty Girl" as she dances with background dancers while the words "Naughty Girl" are displayed on the screen behind her.	隨著與背景舞者一起跳舞，同時《Naughty Girl》的字樣顯示在她身後的螢幕上，她請人群中的女孩唱《Naughty Girl》。
Towards the end of the song she performs portions of Vanity 6's song "Nasty Girl" (1982) as a short dance break.	在歌曲的結尾，她表演了 Vanity 6 的歌曲《Nasty Girl》(1982) 的部分內容，作為短暫的舞蹈休息。
The lights are turned off and later silhouettes of Beyoncé and her dancers appear performing a choreography in front of the screen which is colored white while a backing track is played.	燈光被關閉，Beyoncé 和她的舞者的剪影出現在白色螢幕前表演編舞，同時播放背景音樂。
Stelmach's policy on health care was highlighted by his removal of the province's health care premiums effective the end of 2008.	Stelmach 的醫療保健政策因從 2008 年底開始取消該省的醫療保健保費而受到關注。
Critics had denounced the premiums as being regressive, both because they were the same amount regardless of the payer's income and because people with better-paying jobs often had their premiums covered by their employer.	批評者譴責這些保費會遞減，因為無論付款人有多少收入，保費都相同，而且擁有更高薪水工作的人的保費通常欲由僱主支付。
The opposition Liberal and New Democratic parties had long called for their removal.	反對黨自由黨和新民主黨長期以來一直呼籲將其撤職。
This elimination was announced in a throne speech immediately before the dissolution of the legislature for the 2008 election, although it was initially promised to take effect by 2012.	健保費取消是在 2008 年立法機關解散前夕的王權演講中宣佈的，儘管最初承諾在 2012 年之前生效。
During this campaign, Stelmach promised to increase the capacity of Alberta universities to train doctors and nurses over four years, eventually resulting in the graduation of 225 more doctors, 350 more registered nurses, and 220 licensed practical nurses.	在這次競選期間，Stelmach 承諾在四年內提高亞伯達 (Alberta) 大學培訓醫生和護士的能力，最終成果有 225 名醫生畢業，350 名註冊護士和 220 名持牌執業護士。
After the registrar of the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons called the plan unfeasible, Health Minister Dave Hancock clarified that most of the increase would in fact come from the immigration of foreign doctors to Alberta, rather than from in-province training.	在亞伯達省內科醫生和外科醫生學院的註冊長宣布該計劃不可行之後，衛生部長 Dave Hancock 澄清說，大部分成長實際上將來自外國醫生移民到亞伯達省，而不是來自省內培訓。
Following the election, Stelmach's new Minister of Health, Ron Liepert, released the government's new health plan.	選舉結束後，Stelmach 的新任衛生部長 Ron Liepert 發佈了政府的新健康計劃。
In it, Liepert refused to characterize the problems in the health care system as being the result of doctor shortages, and instead promised structural reforms.	在健康計劃中，Liepert 拒絕將醫療保健系統的問題描述為醫生短缺的結果，而是承諾進行結構性改革。
He indicated that these may include consolidating health authorities, closing rural hospitals, and de-listing some health services from coverage under the province's public health insurance scheme.	他指出，這些措施可能包括合併衛生部、關閉農村醫院，以及將一些衛生服務從該省公共醫療保險計劃的覆蓋範圍中刪除。
In May, the government took the first step in implementing these structural reforms by combining the province's nine health authorities into one health "superboard".	今年 5 月，政府邁出了實施這些結構性改革的第一步，將全省的九個衛生部門合併為一個衛生「超級委員會」。
In June 2008, three senior health officials announced that they would be leaving the province's employment at the expiration of their contracts in August.	2008 年 6 月，三名高級衛生官員宣布，他們將在 8 月合約到期時離開該省的工作崗位。
Liepert blamed their departures on better offers from other employers, although New Democrat leader Brian Mason speculated that the government's health restructuring may have been to blame.	Liepert 將他們的離職歸咎於其他雇主提供更好的報價，儘管新民主黨領袖 Brian Mason 推測政府的健康重組可能是罪魁禍首。
Detractors pointed out that the optics of allowing the employees to depart for more money elsewhere soon after the government had approved a substantial pay hike for cabinet ministers were not good.	批評者指出，在政府批准內閣部長大幅加薪後不久，允許員工離開其他地方以獲得更多資金的前景並不好。
As the province's fiscal situation worsened in late 2008, the government adapted its health policy.	隨著該省的財政狀況在2008年底惡化，政府調整了其健保政策。
In December, Liepert announced a new seniors drug plan that made drugs free for seniors making less than $21,325 but required those making more to pay as much as $7,500 for their drugs.	去年 12 月，Liepert 宣佈了一項新的年長者藥物計劃，該計劃為收入低於 21,325 美元的年長者免費提供藥物，但要求收入更高的人為他們的藥物支付高達 7,500 美元的費用。
In response to protests from seniors, he amended the plan in April 2009 to reduce both the income level at which seniors would have to start paying and the amount which those seniors would have to pay.	為了回應年長者的抗議，他在 2009 年 4 月修改了該計劃，降低年長者必須開始支付的收入水準和年長者必須支付的金額。
Liepert said that the plan, $10 million more expensive than the one he had announced in December, would see 60% of seniors pay less than they did under the status quo.	Liepert 說，該計劃比他在 12 月宣布的計劃費用高出 1000 萬美元，將使 60% 的年長者支付的費用低於他們在現狀的價格。
The same month, Stelmach's government's budget revealed changes to which medical services it would cover: those de-listed included chiropractic services, at an annual savings of $53 million, and sex change operations, at an annual savings of $700,000.	同月，Stelmach 政府的預算披露該計劃將承保的醫療服務變化，不在承保範圍內的項目包括：每年節省 5300 萬美元的脊椎按摩療法服務，以及每年節省 70 萬美元的變性手術。
While the Canada Health Act requires the federal government to financially penalize provinces that do not support all "medically necessary" procedures, Liepert maintained that the de-listed services were not "medically necessary" from the perspective of the Act, and said that he anticipated no trouble from the federal government.	雖然《加拿大健保法》(Canada Health Act) 要求聯邦政府對不支援所有「醫療必要」程序的省份進行經濟處罰，但 Liepert 堅持認為，從該法案的角度來看，程不在承保範圍內的服務在「醫療上是必要的」，並表示他預期聯邦政府不會遇到困難。
During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Stelmach initially announced that the government would make the vaccine available to all Albertans, though vaccine shortages resulted in a limited number of clinics, which experienced long lineups.	在 2009 年 H1N1 流感大流行期間，Stelmach 最初宣佈政府將向所有亞伯達省人提供疫苗，儘管疫苗短缺導致診所數量有限，但這些診所經歷大排長龍。
Wright died at home in London of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65.	London 於 2008 年 9 月 15 日在倫敦的家中因癌症去世，享年 65 歲。
At the time of his death, he had been working on a new solo album, which was thought to comprise a series of instrumental pieces.	在他去世時，他一直在製作一張新的個人專輯，該專輯被認為包括一系列樂器作品。
The surviving members of Pink Floyd paid Wright tribute.	Pink Floyd 的倖存成員向 Wright 致敬。
Waters said "it is hard to overstate the importance of his musical voice in the Pink Floyd of the '60s and '70s" and was happy that they had managed to reunite for Live 8. Mason said Wright's contributions to Floyd were under-rated, and that his playing "was the sound that knitted it all together", comparing his "quiet one" status in the band to George Harrison.	Waters 說：「很難誇大他的音樂聲音在 60 年代和 70 年代的 Pink Floyd中的重要性」，並且很高興他們能夠為 Live 8 重聚。Mason 說，Wright 對 Floyd 的貢獻被低估了，他的演奏「是將所有聲音交織在一起」，並比較將他與 George Harrison 在樂隊中的「安靜」狀態。
Gilmour called him "my musical partner and my friend", praised the ability of the two men's voices to blend, such as on "Echoes".	Gilmour 稱他為「我的音樂搭檔和我的朋友」，稱讚兩人的聲音融合能力，比如在《Echoes》中。
Wright's death brought Pink Floyd to a formal end, with Gilmour re-iterating that it would be wrong to resume touring without him.	Wright 辭世使 Pink Floyd 正式結束，Gilmour 重申，沒有他恢復巡演是錯誤的。
On the day of Wright's death, Elton John, while playing a concert in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada dedicated the song "Believe" to him.	Wright 去世當天，Elton John 在加拿大薩克其萬省薩斯卡通市 (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) 的一場音樂會上將歌曲《Believe》獻給了他。
On 23 September, Gilmour performed "Remember a Day", a Wright composition from Pink Floyd's second album, A Saucerful of Secrets, on a live broadcast of Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two as a tribute to Wright.	9 月 23 日，Gilmour 在《裘斯荷蘭樂之聲》(Later... With Jools Holland) 的現場廣播表演《Remember a Day》作為 Wright 對的致敬，這是 Pink Floyd 第二張專輯中由 Wright 作曲的一首歌。
In an interview later on in the show, Gilmour said that Wright had intended to perform with him that day, but that he had texted Gilmour a couple of weeks before his death to advise him that he would not be well enough to attend.	在節目後期的一次採訪中，Gilmour 說 Wright 那天打算和他一起表演，但他在去世前幾週給 Gilmour 發了簡訊，告訴他身體狀況不佳，無法參加。
Wright's main influence was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane.	Wright 的主要影響是爵士樂，尤其是 Miles Davis 和 John Coltrane。
He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of music with a theme, later saying "if the words came out like the music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written".	他從不認為自己是典型的詞曲作者，他更喜歡創作一整張有主題的音樂專輯，後來他說：「如果歌詞像音樂信手拈來，而我們沒有別的事情可做，就會寫出相當多的歌曲」。
A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates.	Wright 創作的許多作品都是即興創作和隨機嘗試的想法，其中一些被他的樂隊夥伴熱情地撿起來。
Wright later said "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen".	Wright 後來說：「我只是玩，並沒有真正考慮我在做什麼，我只是隨心隨性。」
Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.	在所有 Pink Floyd 成員中，Wright 最保守，他坐在鍵盤後面，專注於音樂。
In the 1970s, Wright listened to some contemporary progressive rock bands, and particularly liked early Peter Gabriel-fronted Genesis.	在 1970 年代， Wright 聽了一些當代前衛搖滾樂隊，特別喜歡早期的 Peter Gabriel 前衛 Genesis。
He later asked some of the musicians in Gabriel's solo touring band to play on Broken China.	後來，他邀請 Gabriel 的獨奏巡演樂隊中的一些音樂家在 Broken China 上演奏。
Wright enjoyed playing the organ, and considered the style he used in Pink Floyd to be unique.	Wright 喜歡演奏管風琴，並認為他在 Pink Floyd 中使用的風格是獨一無二的。
He played solos in the early part of Floyd's career, frequently using Egyptian scales, such as on "Matilda Mother" or "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun".	在 Floyd 職業生涯的早期，他獨奏時經常使用埃及音階，如《Matilda Mother》或《Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun》。
His jazz background led to him being interested in free form music, with adherence to tempo being less important.	他的爵士樂背景使他對自由形式的音樂感興趣，堅持節奏並不那麼重要。
Later, he was more interested in complementing each piece with organ, electric piano or synthesizer as a backing instrument, while still featuring occasional solos.	後來，他更感興趣的是用管風琴，電鋼琴或合成器作為背景樂器來補充每首曲子，同時仍然偶爾獨奏。
Production on the episode began on September 14, 2004, and ran through to September 22.	該集的製作於 2004 年 9 月 14 日開始，一直持續到 9 月 22 日。
The standing sets were used for the first three days of filming.	拍攝的前三天採用站立式佈景。
Further sets were created to represent the Vulcan Embassy and portions of the Forge.	為了代表火神大使館和鍛造廠的一部分，還創作了更多的佈景。
The final two days were filmed on site in Simi Valley in southern California, which doubled as the main areas of the Forge.	最後兩天是在加利福尼亞州南部的西米谷 (Simi Valley) 現場拍攝，該山谷是鍛造廠的主要區域。
The property used in the valley was owned by mining company P.W. Gillibrand, which was near property owned by Vulcan Materials Company.	山谷中使用的財產由礦業公司 P.W. Gillibrand 擁有，該公司靠近 Vulcan Materials Company 擁有的財產。
Optical effects were added to represent the firestorm and the sehlat.	增添光學效果來表示火風暴和 Sehlat 獸。
The CGI sehlat was based on one which previously appeared in Star Trek: The Animated Series episode "Yesteryear".	CGI sehlat 基於之前出現在《星際爭霸戰：動畫版系列》劇集《過去的歲月》(Yesteryear) 中的一個角色。
Visual effects producer Dan Curry said that the team "looked at the animated series and it just looked nice and pleasant, so I did a couple of sketches to do a reinterpretation of it to make it look scary, but not be too radical a departure from the original".	視覺效果製作人 Dan Curry 說，團隊「看了動畫系列，它看起來很好，很愉快，所以我做了幾個草圖來重新解釋它，讓它看起來很嚇人，但又不會太激進地偏離原版」。
Eden FX modelled the CGI under supervision by staff visual effects supervisor Art Codron.	Eden FX 在工作人員視覺效果總監 Art Codron 的監督下對 CGI 進行了建模。
Additional care was taken to create the fur so that close-ups could be used if required.	在製作毛皮時還採取額外措施，可在需要時使用特寫鏡頭。
The only physical portion of the sehlat to be created was a single paw. "Yesteryear" was set in the Vulcan city Shi'Khar, which reappears in "The Forge", and it is also the first mention of the area on Vulcan called the Forge.	唯一要創作的 sehlat 有形部分是一隻爪子。《過去的歲月》以火神之城 Shi'Khar 為背景，在《鍛造廠》(The Forge) 中再次出現，這也是火神島上第一次提到被稱為鍛造廠的地區。
A further reference was made to "Vulcan's Forge" in the Deep Space Nine episode "Change of Heart".	在《銀河前哨》(Deep Space Nine) 的《Change of Heart》一集中，進一步提到了「火神的鍛造」(Vulcan's Forge)。
"The Forge" and the following two episodes make reference to a time of savagery in Vulcan history known as the "Time of Awakening".	《鍛造廠》和以下兩集引用了火神歷史上被稱為「覺醒時代」(Time of Awakening) 的野蠻時期。
This had been previously mentioned in the original series episodes "Balance of Terror", "All Our Yesterdays", and "The Savage Curtain", as well as The Next Generation episode "Gambit".	這在最初的系列劇集《恐怖平衡》(Balance of Terror)、《All Our Yesterdays》和《野蠻的帷幕》(The Savage Curtain) 以及下一代劇集《Gambit》中已經提到過。
The story mentioned the Vulcan T'Pau, who had previously appeared in The Original Series episode "Amok Time" presiding over the fight between Kirk and Spock, with the elder T'Pau portrayed by Celia Lovsky. Michael Reilly Burke returns as Koss, having previously appeared in the role in the season-four episode "Home".	這個故事提到了火神 T'Pau，他之前曾出現在原始系列劇集《Amok Time》中，主持 Kirk 和 Spock 之間的戰鬥，老 T'Pau 由 Celia Lovsky 飾演。Michael Reilly Burke 以 Koss 的身份回歸，之前曾在第四季的《Home》中出現過這個角色。
Robert Foxworth appears as Administrator V'Las, having previously appeared as Admiral Leyton in the Deep Space Nine episodes "Homefront" and "Paradise Lost".	Robert Foxworth 以管理員 V'Las 的身份出現，此前曾在《銀河前哨》(Deep Space Nine) 的《家園》(Homefront) 和《失樂園》(Paradise Lost) 中飾演萊頓海軍上將 (Admiral Leyton)。
Husband and wife duo Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens had previously written a number of Star Trek-related novels and books, including a series of collaborations with William Shatner and the novel Federation.	夫妻二人組 Judith 和 Garfield Reeves-Stevens 之前寫過許多與《星際爭霸戰》相關的小說和書籍，包括與 William Shatner 的一系列合作及小說《聯邦》(Federation)。
They had also written several nonfiction books on the behind-the-scenes productions of the Star Trek series such as Star Trek: Phase II - The Lost Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Continuing Mission.	他們還寫了幾本關於《星際爭霸戰》系列幕後製作的非小說類書籍，如《星際爭霸戰：Phase II - The Lost Series》和《星際爭霸戰：The Next Generation - The Continuing Mission》。
"The Forge" was their first script together for a Star Trek series, but they had previously written scripts for other shows, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World and Once a Thief.	《鍛造廠》是他們為《星際爭霸戰》系列合作的第一個劇本，但他們之前還為其他節目寫過劇本，包括 Arthur Conan Doyle 爵士的《失落的世界》(The Lost World) 和《Once a Thief》。
They joined the Enterprise writing team shortly before working on the story for this episode which formed the first part of a planned "Vulcan arc".	他們不久後加入了企業寫作團隊，然後為這一集撰寫了故事，這一集構成了計劃中的《Vulcan arc》的第一部。
After reading an article about the iLoo, Andrew Cubitt, inventor of the similarly named i-Loo, wrote to The Inquirer stating that iLoo "sounds remarkably similar ... it now seems that the clever people at Microsoft have cottoned onto the idea and even call it the i-Loo, the same as mine!" Cubitt went on to say that "mine did everything that the Microsoft one is meant to do, but additionally printed information on toilet paper and didn't use a keyboard for the interface due to hygiene reasons".	名稱相近的 i-Loo 發明人 Andrew Cubitt 在讀了一篇關於 iLoo 的文章後，投書到《詢問者》說 iLoo「聽來很像...看來微軟公司裡的聰明人接受這個概念，甚至也把它叫做 i-Loo，跟我的一樣！」Cubitt 接著說，「微軟的和我的軟體功能一模一樣，但我另外把資訊印在衛生紙上，而不使用鍵盤，因為這樣比較衛生。」
The i-Loo was prototyped by Cubitt as part of his thesis for his 2001 university degree in Product Design and Engineering at Brunel University.	i-Loo 是 Cubbit 在 2001 年就讀汶萊大學產品設設與工程系時，為撰寫學位論文而做出的原形。
In an interview with The Inquirer, he noted "As it was designed at the university, they own the partial rights to the product so they will be watching the Microsoft 'invention' very closely."	在《詢問者》的一次專訪裡，他指出「由於是在大學中設計的，因此大學擁有產品部分權利；大學會仔細檢視微軟的這項『發明』』。
Microsoft never formally commented on Cubitt's allegations and instead initially stated the iLoo was an April's fool joke.	微軟從未正式回應 Cubitt 的指控，卻開始說 iLoo 只是個愚人節的玩笑。
As a result, Cubitt questioned whether this was "a very calculated ploy to destroy competition in its early stages, or is admitting they don't even know what time of the month it is less embarrassing and ridding them of a potentially expensive situation!" Cubitt went on to state that "as they have now discredited my idea as a joke, I will never be able to produce the idea" and as such was "consulting my law books now on defamatory statements".	因此，Cubitt 質疑這是一場「精心算計的計謀，在一開始就破壞競爭；微軟也可以承認他們不知道何時才能顯得不那麼尷尬，擺脫可能付出的昂貴代價！」Cubbit 繼續說，「現在他們把我的創意貶抑成一個笑話，所以我再也無法把它變成產品了」，「我現在正在查看和誹謗言論相關的法律書」。
Neither Cubitt, nor Brunel University have taken public legal action against Microsoft pertaining to the i-Loo.	Cubitt 和汶萊大學都不曾針對 i-Loo 對微軟提告。
The i-Loo was described as:	i-Loo 的說明如下：

The unit is fixed in front of a toilet on the cubical [sic] wall.	該裝置固定在牆上廁紙架的前方。
The product provides up to date information about new products, daily news and lottery results through an easy to navigate software package.	該產品透過易於使用的軟體，提供各種新產品、每日新聞、樂透開獎結果的最新資訊。
Normal operation of the toilet and paper dispenser is evident.	當然，廁紙供給器可以如常使用。
The i-Loo internet toilet roll browser was featured at the 2003 Daily Mail Ideal Home Show as part of the Future Concepts exhibition in Earls Court, London, where it was nominated for the MFI Bright Sparks 2003 awards.	i-Loo 網路捲筒衛生紙瀏覽器，在 2003 年每日郵報理想家庭展覽，以及倫敦伯爵府未來概念展中展出；同時還獲得 2003 年 MFI 亮眼產品大獎。
The i-Loo, which was sponsored by Epson Printers, received significant press coverage, and was featured on GMTV as well as various radio shows.	獲得 Epson 印表機贊助的 i-Loo 獲得廣泛媒體報導，也在 GMTV 與多家電台節目中露出。
His daughter Lidya Steinhaus was married to Jan Kott.	他的女兒 Lydia Steinhaus 與 Jan Kott 結婚。
On November 1, 2017, a controversy arose as the University of Wrocław took no action to pay for his grave to keep it until 2022 in face of its expiration because it supposedly "had no money".	2017 年 11 月 1 日，樂斯拉夫大學因為「經費短缺」而未能支付到 2022 年為止的墓園費用，因而引發爭議。
Mayor Rafał Dutkiewicz was also widely criticized for doing nothing.	市長 Rafal Dutkiewicz 也因無所作為而廣遭批評。
Random people organized a charity and paid for the grave to remain.	許多善心人士發動捐款活動，支付墓園管理費用，使其可以留存。
Born in Forbes, New South Wales, on 27 February 1903, Lester Brain was the second son of an English mining engineer and manager, Austin Brain, and his Australian wife, Katie.	Lester Brain 在 1903 年 2 月 27 日生於新南威爾斯的福布斯，是英國礦業工程師兼經理 Austin Brain 與其澳洲籍妻子 Katie 的次子。
Originally from Gloucestershire, Austin had emigrated with his parents and siblings in 1885, prospecting for gold in the United States before settling in Australia.	Austin 出身英國格羅斯特郡，在 1885 年和雙親與兄弟姐妹舉家遷至美國，以追逐當時的淘金潮，之後移居澳洲。
By the age of thirteen, Lester owned his own motorcycle bought secondhand for £11; its poor condition and constant need for repair helped him become mechanically adept at an early age.	13 歲左右，Lester 就以 11 英鎊買了自己的二手摩托車；由於車況很差，經常需要修理，使得他很早就精於各種機械。
He completed his education at Sydney Grammar School, where he excelled in maths, before being employed by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (CBC) in 1919.	他畢業於雪梨文法學校，特別擅長數學，後來在 1919 年任職於雪梨商業銀行公司（CBC）。
Brain's penchant for motorbikes and things mechanical inspired a lift driver at CBC to suggest he apply for pilot training in the recently formed Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).	Brain 對機車的熱情，以及機械方面的天份，讓 CBC 公司內的一位升降機司機大為驚奇，推薦他向剛成立的皇家澳洲空軍 (RAAF) 申請飛機駕駛訓練。
He was among five civilian students nominated by the Civil Aviation Branch (CAB) of the Defence Department for entry into the inaugural RAAF flying training course, which commenced at Point Cook, Victoria in January 1923.	他是國防部民航局 (CAB) 推薦進入 RAAF 首屆飛行訓練班的五個民間學員之一，該班於 1923 年成立於維多利亞省的庫克。
The benefit of these nominations from a military perspective was that although the destiny of the CAB-sponsored students was to be civil aviators, they would also be members of the RAAF reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF), and could therefore be called up for active service as and when necessary.	從軍事角度來看，提名這些人的好處是，雖然這些由 CAB 贊助的學員，最後都會成為民航機飛行員，但可以充任 RAAF 後備飛官，亦即市民空軍 (CAF)，在需要他們服役時即可派上戰場。
Brain's fellow attendees included Royal Australian Navy lieutenants Joe Hewitt and Ellis Wackett, and Australian Army lieutenant Frank Bladin, all of whom were seconded—and later permanently transferred—to the RAAF.	Brain 的同期同學包括皇家澳洲海軍中尉 Joe Hewitt 與 Ellis Wackett，以及澳洲陸軍中尉 Frank Bladin；這些人後來都支持 RAAF，之後也永久成為 RAAF 的一員。
Brain graduated at the top of his class after the year-long training course at Point Cook, and was duly commissioned in the CAF.	Brain 在 Point Cook 為期一年的訓練課程中拿到全班第一名，立即受到 CAF 委任。
Moving to Queensland in April 1924, he took up employment as a pilot with Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services (Qantas), its first aviator without a war record.	他在 1924 年移居昆士蘭，出任昆士蘭與北疆航空公司 (Qantas) 的飛行員，且是第一個不曾上過戰場的機師。
On 7 February 1925, he flew the first scheduled passenger service from Cloncurry to Camooweal, extending the airline's founding 580-mile (930 km) route—from Charleville to Cloncurry—by 284 miles (457 km).	1925 年 2 月 7 日，他首次執飛自吉朗卡列飛往卡木維爾的定期客機，將該公司成立以來自查爾斯維爾到吉朗卡列，距離約 580 英哩 (930 公里 )的航路，一口氣延長了 284 英哩 (457 公里)。
The following year, he completed a refresher course at Central Flying School, Point Cook.	隔年，他在 Point Cook 的中央飛行學校完成再訓練課程。
On a rain-soaked McKinlay airfield near Cloncurry on 27 February 1927, he flipped Qantas' first de Havilland DH.50 on to its back while attempting take-off, though he managed to escape without injury.	1927 年 2 月 27 日，當他在吉朗卡列附近的麥金利機場，在大雨天中駕駛澳航首架 de Havilland DH.50 型飛機時發生翻覆意外，所以他及時逃生，毫髮無傷。
Qantas founder Hudson Fysh berated him for a "serious error of judgement", but noted his excellent three-year record as a pilot; the aircraft was soon repaired and operational again.	澳航創辦人 Hudson Fysh 痛斥他犯下「嚴重誤判」，但也注意到他三年來優異的飛行記錄；那架飛機很快修好並且重新投入營運。
The next month, Brain became Chief Instructor at the Qantas Flying School in Brisbane, doubling as manager of the airline's local office.	隔月，Brain 出任布里斯班澳航飛行學校的總教官，兼任該公司當地辦公室經理。
By mid-1928, he had overworked himself to the extent that he was ordered to take respite by Fysh; this "respite" nevertheless involved a 13-week trip to England to study aviation developments.	在 1928 年中，他由於工作過勞，被 Fysh 下令暫時停飛休息；但這個在為期 13 的「休假」行程，他還是去了英國研習航空的發展。
In April 1929, Brain was selected to take part in a search for lost aviators in northern Australia, having gained experience of the area while flying over the Tanami Desert to assist a gold prospecting expedition some years earlier.	1929 年 4 月，Brian 受命參與在澳洲北方搜救失蹤飛行員的任務；在那之前他曾飛越塔納米沙漠以協助發掘金礦，而這次任務讓他對該地區更具經驗。
On 20 April, he took Qantas DH.50 Atalanta from Brisbane to link up with RAAF Airco DH.9s under the command of Flight Lieutenant Charles Eaton at Tennant Creek, to look for Keith Anderson and Robert Hitchcock in their Westland Widgeon the Kookaburra.	4 月 20 日，他駕駛澳航 DH.50 型，與由 Tennant Creek 的飛行教官 Charles Eaton 指揮的 RAAF Airco DH9 機隊，一同搜救駕駛 Westland Widgeon 型直升機「笑翠鳥號」的 Keith Anderson 和 Robert Hitchcock。
The pair had disappeared while searching for Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm, who had been reported missing on a record attempt from Sydney to England in the Southern Cross.	這兩人是在搜救 Charles Kingsford Smith 與 Charles Ulm 時失蹤；後者據報是在駕駛南十字星號，自雪梨飛往英國途中失蹤。
Brain located the Kookaburra the next day in the Tanami Desert, approximately 130 kilometres (81 mi) east-south-east of Wave Hill.	Brain 隔天在塔納利沙漠中發現「笑翠鳥號」，約在 Wave 山東南東方約 130 公里處 (80 英哩)。
Galadriel was originally named Artanis (Q. 'ar'=noble, 'nis'=woman, a name common to royal women of the Elves, most prominently as in the form Arwen, Galadriel's granddaughter), and Nerwen (Q. 'ner'=man, 'wen'=maiden, hence manly maiden), referring to her height and strength; Galadriel is the Sindarinized version of Telerin Quenya Alatáriel (Q. 'alatá'=radiance, 'riel'=maiden crowned with a garland), a name given her by Celeborn, referring to her silver-golden hair.	凱蘭崔爾一開始被命名為 Artanis (Ar 意指高貴，nis 指女性，這名字在精靈界的皇家女性中十分常見，最有名的就是凱蘭崔爾的孫女亞雯) 和 Nerwen ( ner 意指男性，wen 則指少女，此處以少女為主) ，指的是她的高貴與能力；凱蘭崔爾是 Telerin Quenya Alatariel 的辛達林語版本名字 (alata 是指光輝、riel 指戴著花冠的少女)。凱勒鵬如此命名，意指凱蘭崔爾金銀色的頭髮。
The name Galadhriel (S. 'galadh'=tree, 'riel'=crowned maiden) was used outside Lórien by the people who did not know the ancient days and Galadriel's history, confusing galad with the Sindarin word galadh and the name of the Galadhrim, the people of Lórien.	在羅林之外，不了解古代史與凱蘭崔爾過去的人，會用凱蘭迪爾 ( galadh 指樹木，riel 指加冕的少女) 之名，將 galad、辛達林語中的 galadh，以及意指羅林人的 Galadhrim 混為一談。
As the ruler of Lothlórien, she was referred to by a variety of titles, including "Lady of Lórien", "Lady of the Wood", and (by Gimli) "Queen Galadriel"—although, according to Tolkien's account in Unfinished Tales, neither she nor Celeborn took royal titles themselves, as they considered themselves merely guardians of Lórien.	身為洛斯羅林的統治者，她擁有多個不同頭銜，如「羅林女王」和金靂所稱的「凱蘭崔爾女王」；不過據托爾金在「未完成的故事」中的說法，不論是她或凱勒鵬，都不曾自稱皇室頭銜，因為他們認為自己只是羅林的守護者而已。
She was also referred to as "Lady of Light" (the translation of Galadriel) or as the "White Lady", as her fair skin and white cloaks made her seem to shine.	也有人稱她「光之女王」（即凱蘭崔爾的譯義），或因她美麗的肌膚與看來閃耀無比的白袍，而稱她為「白色女王」。
It was said (by the Dúnedain) that her height was two rangar (Quenya: 'strides'), or "man-high" – about 6 ft. 4 in., or 193 cm.	據登丹人說她的身高有兩個跨步，或「一個長人」，約有 6 呎 4 吋（193公分）高。
However, Galadriel's most striking feature is her beautiful long silver-golden hair.	不過，凱蘭崔爾最特別的，還是她一頭金銀色的美麗長髮。
The Elves of Tirion said it captured the radiance of the Two Trees Laurelin and Telperion themselves.	提理安的精靈說，它獲得了雙聖樹金樹羅瑞林與銀樹泰爾佩瑞安的光輝。
Even among the Eldar she was accounted beautiful, and her hair is held a marvel unmatched.	即使在神族中，她也是無比美麗，特別是一頭秀髮更是無人可比。
It is golden like the hair of her father and of her foremother Indis, but richer and more radiant, for its gold is touched by some memory of the starlike silver of her mother; and the Eldar say that the light of the Two Trees, Laurelin and Telperion, has been snared in her tresses.	那種金色就她父親和女性祖先 Indis，但更加光澤耀眼，她母親如星光般的銀色記憶也摻入其中，神族人說雙聖樹羅瑞林與泰爾佩瑞安發出的光芒，也混入了她的秀髮之中。
It was greatly admired by Fëanor and may have inspired him to create the Silmarilli.	費諾非常喜愛這點，也促使他創造出精靈寶鑽。
Many thought that this saying first gave to Fëanor the thought of imprisoning and blending the light of the Trees that later took shape in his hands as the Silmarils.	許多人認為這種說法，開始讓費諾想到把雙聖樹的光芒禁錮並混入到後來他打造出的精靈寶鑽之中。
For Fëanor beheld the hair of Galadriel with wonder and delight.	對費諾來說，注視凱蘭崔爾的頭髮，就能帶來驚歎與喜悅。
Nevertheless, she never repaid Fëanor's admiration with the generosity she showed to Gimli the Dwarf in The Fellowship of the Ring.	但是，她從來不曾像對待矮人金靂和魔戒遠征隊那樣慷慨回報費諾的讚美。
Fëanor "had begged her thrice for a tress and thrice she refused to give him even one hair.	費諾「曾經三次向她請求賜髮，而她三次都拒絕了，一根也沒給
It is said that these two kinsfolk, being considered the greatest of the Eldar of Valinor, remain unfriends forever."	據說這兩位維林諾的艾爾達精靈一族中最偉大的人，此後一直都不相往來。
Her character was similarly a blend of characteristics of the kindreds of the Eldar from whom she was descended.	她的個性明顯有一部分來自祖先艾爾達人的特徵。
She had the pride and ambition of the Noldor, but in her they were tempered by the gentleness and insight of the Vanyar.	她擁有諾多族的驕傲與野心，但也受到來自凡雅族溫和與智慧特質的撫平。
She shared the latter virtues of character with her father Finarfin and her brother Finrod.	她和父親費納芬與哥哥芬羅德一樣，都擁有凡雅族的特質。
She was proud, strong, and self-willed, as were all the descendants of Finwë save Finarfin; and like her brother Finrod, of all her kin the nearest to her heart, she had dreams of far lands and dominions that might be her own to order as she would without tutelage.	她充滿傲氣、堅強、任性，一如芬威的子嗣中與她最親近的費納芬與哥哥芬羅德一樣，夢想支配遠方的土地和領地，沒有任何人可以管得動她。
Yet deeper still there dwelt in her the noble and generous spirit of the Vanyar, and a reverence for the Valar that she could not forget.	在她內心深處仍然存有凡雅族高貴與慷慨的精神，而她也不能忘卻對勇者的敬意。
Kepler-10b's discovery excited astronomers, who hoped to use data about it to inquire into the formation and structure that terrestrial, Earth-size planets tend to have in common.	Kepler-10b 的發現，讓天文學家大為振奮，希望能夠利用這些資料，找出這類地球型，大小也接近地球的行星形成與結構的共同之處。
Geoff Marcy of the University of California at Berkeley said that the discovery was ranked "as among the most profound scientific discoveries in human history," and that the planet "will go into every textbook worldwide." Marcy also described Kepler-10b as "a bridge between the gas giant planets we've been finding and the Earth itself." Diana Valencia at the University of Côte d'Azur in Nice, France considered the planet more of a "super-Mercury" than a super-Earth, granted its physical characteristics.	加州大學柏克萊分校的 Geoff Marcy 指出，這項發現「可以躋身人類史上最重要的科學發現」，該行星「也將載入全世界各國的教科書中」。Marcy 同時指出 Kepler-10b 「界於我們已經找到的許多氣態巨行星與地球本身之間」。法國尼斯蔚藍海岸大學的 CDiana Valencia 則認為該行星的各種物理特徵，比較接近「超級水星」而非超級地球。
Kepler-10b is most noted for its rocky surface.	Kepler-10b 最負盛名的是其岩石表面。
It has a diameter 1.4 times that of the Earth, and a mass of 3.33±0.49 times that of Earth.	其直徑是地球的 1.4 倍，質量則為地球的 3.33±0.49 倍。
The density of Kepler-10b is 5.8±0.8 g cm⁻³.	Kepler-10b 密度則為 5.8±0.8 g cm⁻³。
It orbits its star, Kepler-10, in less than a day, at less than a twentieth of the distance from Mercury to the Sun.	其環繞母星 Kepler-10 所需時間不到一天，距離不到水星到太陽的二十分之一。
Its surface temperature on the star lit side is approximately 1833 K, which is as hot as a blast furnace and hot enough to melt iron.	該星的表面溫度約為 1833 K，和熾熱的熔爐一樣熱，足以熔化鐵器。
Though CoRoT-7b was discovered before Kepler-10b and has been claimed to be rocky, there is more room for other interpretations in the case of CoRoT-7b's composition than there is for Kepler-10b.	雖然 CoRoT-7b 較 Kepler-10b 先發現，也有人說它具備岩質表面，但和 Kepler-10b 相比，CoRoT-7b 組成的說法有更多爭議。
This is due to the much larger uncertainty in CoRoT-7b's mass (and, to a lesser extent, its radius) which is illustrated in the plot to the left.	主因在於 CoRoT-7b 的質量還有很大的不確定性 (直徑也不太確定），如左圖。
Consequently, CoRoT-7b may be revealed to be a lava-ocean planet, whereas Kepler-10b must be predominantly made of rock or iron.	因此，CoRoT-7b 很可能是個岩漿之海，而 Kepler-10b 則是由岩石或鐵質構成。
In addition to showing the range of masses and radii consistent with the observations of each planet, the plot includes curves of compositions implied by certain masses and radii.	除了要正確展現每個行星質量與直徑的觀測值外，該圖像也包括質量與直徑的曲線。
Kepler-10b is tidally locked to its parent star and has extreme variations in temperature between day and night sides.	Kepler-10b 受其母星潮汐鎖定，日夜溫差變化極端劇烈。
It also reflects about half of the starlight it receives.	該星約反射出所受光照的一半。
The writer for this episode, David A.	本季的作者 David A.
Goodman, said that making this episode was a "dream come true" for many members of the crew including himself.	Goodman 說，該季的製作對包括他本人在內的許多劇組成員來說，可謂「美夢成真」。
At the time he was hired onto the staff, they were already talking about creating a Star Trek-centric episode.	當他受僱成為工作團隊之時，團隊已經在討論製作以星艦迷航記為主的節目。
The initial idea was to have a giant Kirk and Spock fighting over New York-New York Hotel and Casino.	一開始的想法，是讓巨大化的寇克船長與史巴克，在紐約紐約飯店和賭長打架。
Executive producer David X.	執行製作 David X.
Cohen assigned the writing task to Goodman, as they agreed he was the biggest Trek fan of the group.	Cohen 指派 Goodman 撰寫劇本，因為大家公認他是團隊中最死忠的星艦迷。
They agreed to drop the story idea with the giant characters and gave him two weeks to write the script.	大家同意放棄巨大化角色的故事想法，給他兩星期回去寫劇本。
The deadline was complicated as Goodman had to spend the first week on jury duty, and then broke his ankle.	劇本完成一拖再拖，主要是因為在第一周 Goodman 得出庭擔任陪審員，接著又扭傷了腳踝。
Despite this, he described "Where No Fan Has Gone Before" as the most fun he has ever had writing a script.	雖然如此，他說這是他寫起來最有樂趣的劇本，「沒有哪個粉絲可以這樣」。
Series creator Matt Groening stated that while he is a fan of the Star Trek franchise, he has never seen an episode of The Original Series in its entirety, but has seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.	連續劇創作者 Matt Groening 說，雖然他是星艦迷，但從來沒有完整看完一集星艦原創系列節目，不過倒是看過電影版。
Director Pat Shinagawa said that there was a certain amount of jealousy among the crew that she got to work on the episode.	導演 Pat Shinagawa 說，有些劇組成員聽到她要來拍節目，還有點嫉妒她。
All of the living members of the original Star Trek cast agreed to appear in the episode with the exception of James Doohan, whose agent replied with "No way." Because of this, the episode's working title was jokingly named "We got everybody but Scotty" and so Scotty was replaced with "Welshie".	所有星艦角色還活著的演員，都同意在節目中亮相，只有 James Doohan 拒絕；他的經紀人回覆說「別想」。正因如此，節目的暫定名字就戲稱為「所有人都到齊了，只差史考提一個」，而史考提這個角色也被「威爾西」取而代之。

Diamandis told Glamour that Britney Spears influenced a "double-sided" theme for the record of both "innocence" and "darkness".	Diamindis 向 Glamour 說，小甜甜布蘭妮的「雙面」主題也帶來影響，唱片一面是「純真」，一面是「黑暗」。
She described the final product as being "a bit cringe" and reflective of her personal experiences, although noted that its promotional campaign would be "pink and fluffy".	她說最後的製作『有點畏縮」，反映了她的個人經驗，但也說專輯的推廣告活動將會呈現「粉紅與毛絨絨」的風格。

The singer later revealed that because of the dye, her hair started to fall out, so she got a boy's haircut and wore a wig.	歌手後來說因為染劑的關係，她開始掉頭髮，所以之後就剪成男孩樣式的短髮，並且戴假髮。
Becky Bain from Idolator complimented its "retro film stock look" and opined that it "is just a snapshot from some 1970s exploitation movie", while Bradley Stern from MuuMuse jokingly referenced the album track "Homewrecker" when stating that she "looks like a proper Suzy Homemaker! (Or should I say Suzy Homewrecker?)" The artwork for the deluxe version features the same picture of Diamandis, although it is tinted purple.	Idolator 的 Becky Bain 補充說那「看起來像是老電影」，又說「那就是從 1970 年代電影裡的畫面中截取的」；而 MuuMuse 的 Bradley Stern 則開玩笑地在提到專輯中的「Homewrecker」一曲時，說她「看起來就像個 Suzy Homemaker 娃娃（或者應該說是 Suzy Homewrecker?)」豪華版的封面也是同一張 Diamandis 的照片，只是變成紫色調。

The actress agreed after reading the script, believing that the character was "very courageous" with a playful side that would endear her to Rumpelstiltskin.	這位女演員在讀完劇本後同意演出，認為這個角色「非常勇敢」，有著 俏皮的一面，讓她很愛野獸。
During their casting meeting, Kitsis and Horowitz told de Ravin that Belle is defined as a strong intelligent woman in a world that disapproves of those characteristics, and that de Ravin was going to be "tak[ing] the icon of Belle and mak[ing] her a woman."	在選角會議時，Kitsis 和 Howoritz 告訴 de Ravin 說，Belle 的設定是一個堅強而聰明的女性，但其社會並不接受這些特質；而 de Ravin 要「塑造 Belle 的典範，成為典型的女性」。

In the interest of time, Espenson was forced to edit out many plot points, including a failed escape attempt by Belle.	由於時間緊迫，Espenson 被迫放棄許多陰謀點，包括 Bell 一次失敗的脫逃嘗試。
Despite this, she sought to trim down more time from the Storybrooke scenes and "preserve as much as we could of the fairy tale side," as the Belle-Rumpelstiltskin relationship was a love story that needed time to grow in order to be believable.	雖然如此，她還是設法從《歡迎來到童話鎮》的情節中擠出更多時間， 「盡我們之力保留童話故事」，因為 Belle 和野獸的愛情需要更多時間蘊釀，觀眾才會相信。
De Ravin was a fan of the series before being cast and was happy to be able to view the costumes up close, describing her character's gold dress as "absolutely stunning." The casting of her former suitor, Gaston, was announced in December 2011 with Psych actor Sage Brocklebank.	De Ravin 在接演前就是本劇影迷，很高興可以近距離看到化妝，也說她扮演角色的金色服裝「超級亮眼」。飾演前任求婚者 Gaston 的演員，在 2011 年 12 月宣布，由曾演出靈異妙探的 Sage Brocklebank 演出。
De Ravin described the episode's version of Gaston as "maybe not as cocky as the animation [version of him], but it’s funny." Rumpelstiltskin's castle was shot almost entirely on greenscreen, with only a few real props being used.	De Ravin 說該集中的的 Gaston 「似乎不像動畫版中的他那樣驕儌，但是非常有趣」。野獸的城堡幾乎完全以綠幕拍攝，僅使用幾個實景。
It was de Ravin's first time working with this technology, which caused her to become "quite nervous." The physical props helped her with the scenes, and "they ha[d] a fantastic set up of a couple of monitors that you can see a markup of basically how it’s going to look."	這是 de Ravin 頭一次使用這種拍攝技術，因此讓她變得「相當緊張」。實體道具幫她融入場景，「工作人員也設置了兩個螢幕，你可以看到一些指示，知道基本上畫面看起來會是什麼樣子。」
The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.	2013 年由 Hyperion Books 出版的第一季改編小說「Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale」，就寫入了本集。
There are multiple references made to Disney's Beauty and the Beast.	許多處都參考迪士尼版本的《美女與野獸》。
The chipped tea cup that Belle accidentally drops is a reference to the boy-transformed-teacup Chip from the animated film.	Belle 不慎掉落造成的破一角茶杯，就是參考了動畫電影中小男孩變成的茶杯角色 Chip。
Also, Rumplestiltskin was referred to as a "beast" by Belle's father.	同時，Bell 的父親也把 Rumplestiltskin 叫做野獸。
Belle's fiancée in the show is named Gaston, the Disney antagonist, and he was turned into a red rose, which featured prominently in the film.	劇中 Belle 的未婚夫叫做 Gaston，在迪士尼版本中是反派，劇中他變成一朵紅玫瑰，演技十分精湛。
In addition, most of Belle's clothing in the fantasy world appears to be directly inspired by the Disney film, such as her classic yellow ballgown and her blue-and-white plainclothes.	此外，Belle 在童話世界中的服裝，看來是直接受到迪士尼動畫片的啟發，例如她的古典黃色禮服，以及藍白雙色的平日穿著。
